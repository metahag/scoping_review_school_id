Acquisition of a Picture Prompt Strategy To Increase Independent Performance;"Copeland, Susan R.; Hughes, Carolyn";Two high school students with severe disabilities were taught to perform job tasks using a two-step process: touching a picture to prompt initiation of a task and turning a picture in a booklet to indicate task completion. As participants acquired the picture prompt strategy, their independent task initiations increased. (Contains references.)

Role of music therapy in social skills development in children with moderate intellectual disability;"Duffy, Barbara; Fuller, Ray";Investigated the effectiveness of a music therapy program in the enhancement of the social skills of children with moderate intellectual disability. 32 children (aged 5–10 yrs) from 4 intellectual disability centers participated. At each center, 4 children were randomly selected to participate in the music therapy program, while 4 children were assigned to a non-music control group program. One staff member was trained in each group procedure at each center, and requested to run 30-min group sessions twice weekly over an 8-wk intervention period. Five social skills were targeted for intervention: turn-taking, imitation, vocalization, initiation and eye contact. Measures of effectiveness involved comparison of pre- and postintervention scores on 5 target skills using a brief social skills test specifically designed for the study. Evaluation forms completed by teachers also provided feedback on the effectiveness of the intervention. The results reflect significant improvements in the 5 target social skills across both conditions following the 8-wk intervention. However, this difference was found to be independent of the music/non-music intervention. The operational definitions of the skills constituting the social skills test are appended.

Promoting Self-Determination: Using Take Action to Teach Goal Attainment;"German, S.L.; Martin, J.E.; Huber Marshall, L.; Sale, R.P.";Transition programs that teach self-determination skills must provide students the opportunity to practice these skills. Teaching students goal attainment skills and providing them the opportunity to achieve their own IEP goals is one example of a self-determination oriented transition program. Take Action teaches students the skills needed to attain their goals. In this study, we taught Take Action to 6 adolescents with mild to moderate mental retardation to attain their daily IEP goals. Results show that all students learned to attain their own daily goals and maintained these skills following withdrawal of teacher instruction. © 2000, Sage Publications.

Self-prompted Communication Book Use to Increase Social Interaction Among High School Students;"Hughes, Carolyn; Rung, Lori L.; Wehmeyer, Michael L.; Agran, Martin; Copeland, Susan R.; Hwang, Bogseon";This investigation examined the effects of self prompted communication book training provided by peers on the conversational initiations of four high school students with extensive support needs. The intervention was associated with increases in participants' appropriate initiations and general education conversational partners' corresponding responses. The self -prompting strategy also was associated with increases in conversational topics discussed and decreases in inap propriate initiations by participants. In addition, interviews conducted postintervention generally indicated that participants believed they had (a) met their social goals to increase their interactions with their general education peers and (b) made more friends at school. Implications of findings are discussed and suggestions made for future programmatic efforts.;2000;2000-09-01;Journal of the Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps;25;3;153-166;;10.2511/rpsd.25.3.153;;#45927;Hughes 2000;systematic_review_manual

The effects of a teacher editor, peer editing, and serving as a peer editor on elementary students' self-editing behavior;Jodlowski, Sheila Marie;Three experiments were done on the effects of the functional relations between peer editing, teacher editing, and serving as a peer editor on student self-editing behavior and maintenance. Experiment I tested the effects of peer editing and compared it to the effects of teacher editing on the acquisition of self-editing skills. The participants in Experiment I were three seventh grade students with learning disabilities and one third grade student with developmental delays. Learn units to criterion were measured and results indicated that the peer editing package resulted in completion of essays with fewer learn units to criterion than the teacher editor alone treatment. Self-editing probes resulted in fewer learn units to criterion after the peer editing treatment than after the teacher editing treatment. These results remained the same regardless of treatment order. Experiment II examined the relationship between a teacher editor and a peer editor, however, the writer was not serving as an editor, but rather only receiving peer feedback. This allowed for further analysis of whether the peer editor was having an effect on the writer's behavior. The experiment examined a teacher editor treatment and peer editor treatment without the writer functioning as an editor. The students that participated in Experiment II were classified as having developmental delays and language disorders. The results of Experiment II did not indicate a significant effect in a peer editor treatment as compared to a teacher editor treatment. The effects seen in self-editing acquisition did not maintain over time. The effects seen in accuracy of self-editing skills were inconsistent across students. Experiment III was conducted to examine the effects between a teacher editor and a teacher editor while the writer was serving as a peer editor. The purpose of this experiment was to further examine the controlling variables involved in peer editing. The two treatments were examined with regard to their effects on self-editing acquisition, maintenance over time, and accuracy of self-editing. The participants in this experiment were two students, one with a language disorder and one with developmental delays. The results of this experiment indicated that a teacher editor while the writer was serving as a peer editor had a significant effect on self-editing acquisition as well as on maintenance probes over time. These data showed that essays were completed in fewer learn units to criterion as well as maintaining this effect over time. The effects seen in accuracy of self-editing skills indicated that the students were more accurate in the self-editing process after the writer editing treatment than after the teacher editor alone treatment. These effects on accuracy maintained over time.

Effects of a graduated instructional sequence on the algebraic subtraction of integers by secondary students with learning disabilities;"Maccini, Paula; Ruhl, Kathy L.";For many students with learning disabilities (LDs), difficulties with higher-order reasoning and problem-solving skills that embody higher-level mathematics hinder success in this area. Thus, adequate instruction is needed for students with LDs to meet the demands for math skills needed in future educational and occupational settings. To address this need, an instructional strategy was developed. A multiple-probe-sign across subjects was used to investigate effects of the strategy on solution of algebra problems involving subtraction of integers for 3 male adolescents with LDs. Students moved through 3 levels of instruction: (a) concrete (i.e., manipulating physical objects to represent mathematics problems), (b) semi-concrete (i.e., drawing pictorial representations of the problems), and (c) abstract (i.e., writing mathematical symbols to represent and solve problems) and applied a 1st letter acronym, STAR, to help them effectively solve problems. Following instruction, students' percent strategy use and problem-solving skills involving integers improved. Generalization of treatment effects was evident in a near generalization task for 1 student and over time for all students.

The effects of general case training of manding responses on children with severe disabilities;"O'Neill, Robert E.; Faulkner, Cheryl; Horner, Robert H.";Families, applied researchers, and teachers and support providers continue to be interested in effective strategies for teaching generalized repertoires of communicative skills to learners with severe disabilities. The present study assessed the effects of a general case training procedure in establishing manding or requesting responses by three students, aged 5–10 yrs old, with severe disabilities across a range of settings and situations. The data indicated that the general case approach was successful in establishing generalized manding for all three students. The limitations of the study and the implications of these results for future research and application are discussed.

Simultaneous prompting and instructive feedback when teaching chained tasks;"Parrott, K.A.; Schuster, J.W.; Collins, B.C.; Gassaway, L.J.";This study evaluated the effectiveness of the simultaneous prompting procedure when teaching students with moderate to severe mental retardation a chained task (i.e., hand washing). This study also evaluated if students could acquire responses to instructive feedback stimuli presented during training sessions. The effectiveness of these procedures was assessed by using a multiple probe across students design. Acquisition, maintenance, and generalization data were collected and analyzed. Results indicated that the simultaneous prompting procedure was effective in teaching 3 of the 5 students to follow a 16-step task analysis to wash their hands. All students who met criterion maintained and generalized the skills with 100% accuracy. All students acquired some of the instructive feedback stimuli. Future research issues are discussed. © 2000 Human Sciences Press, Inc.;2000;;Journal of Behavioral Education;10;1;3-19;;10.1023/A:1016639721684;;#9863;Parrott 2000;
Computer and pedagogy: Replacing telling with computer assisted instruction for teaching arithmetic skills to mentally retarded children;"Patra, J.; Rath, P. K.";Examined the efficacy of using computers to teach simple arithmetic and the concept of number. Four mentally retarded children (aged 12–14 yrs) were given classroom instruction, with 2 Ss receiving supplemental intensive training for 30 days by means of a computer. Comparison of scores of tests administered before, immediately after training termination, and 1 wk subsequent to training termination show that Ss benefitted significantly from computer-aided instruction.

The Effects of Self-Directed IEP on Student Participation in IEP Meetings;"Allen, S.K.; Smith, A.C.; Test, D.W.; Flowers, C.; Wood, W.M.";This study evaluated the effects of teaching a modified version of Self-Directed IEP to students with moderate mental retardation on participation in their Individual Educational Program (IEP) meetings. Results indicated a functional relationship between the information taught in the modified Self-Directed IEP lesson package and an increase in student participation in their annual IEP meeting. In addition, there were statistically significant increases from pre-training IEP meetings to post-training IEP meetings for all skills. © 2001, Sage Publications.

Teaching secondary students with moderate disabilities in an inclusive academic classroom setting;"Collins, Belva C.; Branson, Terri A.; Hall, Meada; Rankin, Stephanie Wheatley";English teacher and peer tutors used a system of least prompts procedure to teach 4 secondary students (aged 16–19 yrs) with moderate disabilities to write letters within secondary composition class setting. While students without disabilities simultaneously worked on composition assignments, they taught the students with disabilities to write letters that included the following 4 components: (a) heading, (b) greeting, (c) content body, and (d) closing. A multiple probe sign across students evaluated the effectiveness of the procedure. The English teacher collected supplementary data as to the attitudes of the composition class students toward the students with disabilities who participated in their class. Results indicate that it is possible to reliably incorporate direct instruction on functional academic skills within an inclusive setting. However, support for the regular education classroom teacher is desirable. Issues as to isolation within the academic setting and limited teacher interaction are discussed.

The effects of peer delivered self-monitoring strategies on the participation of students with severe disabilities in general education classrooms;"Gilberts, Guy H.; Agran, Martin; Hughes, Carolyn; Wehmeyer, Michael";Investigated the effects of self-monitoring instruction delivered by peer tutors on the occurrence of academic survival skills displayed by 5 middle school students with severe intellectual disabilities in general education classrooms. The students were taught to indicate on a self-recording sheet if they performed each of 11 skills. The results of observations by peer tutors and adult Os show an increase in the percentages of occurrence of survival skills across all students. Also, their general education teachers indicated they observed a positive change for 4 of the 5 students. All students indicated that they believed that they were part of the class and reported an increase in their classroom participation.

Acquisition of content area vocabulary for students with learning disabilities;"Keel, Marie; Slaton, Deborah Bott; Blackhurst, A. Edward";"This study compared the effects of 2 variations of the constant-time-delay (CTD) procedure on the observational learning of students with learning disabilities in a small-group instructional arrangement. Each student was taught to read 2 individualized lists of content area vocabulary words. The target words of other students in the group served as the observational words for each student. An adapted alternating treatments design was used to compare the effects of the 2 instructional conditions on students' target words. In the first condition, a group attentional response (Everybody Writes) condition was used in which all students copied the target word on an erasable board before the target student answered. In the second condition, an individual attentional response (Only Target Student Writes) condition was used; only the target student copied the word on the erasable board before responding. Results indicate that both conditions were equally effective for learning target words, but the Everybody Writes condition was more effective in promoting observational reading of other students' target words. There was no significant interaction effect for spelling of other students' target words.

Naturalistic assessment of and intervention for mouthing behaviors influenced by establishing operations;"Lohrmann-O'Rourke, Sharon; Yurman, Beth";This study provides an example of an innovative practice for the assessment and intervention of mouthing behaviors influenced by an establishing operation. The participant was a 6-year-old boy with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation and a seizure disorder who was attending a self-contained class in his local school. A functional analysis embedded within five activities (i.e., alone time, task demand, play, circle, and eating) during the classroom's typical routine was conducted. Results of the functional analysis suggested mouthing was maintained by multiple functions and most frequently occurred during the alone time, circle time, and task demand activities. The functional analysis also revealed that the participant was more likely to mouth in the presence of an establishing operation (i.e., sinus infection). Preferred items were noncontingently offered using an antecedent choice intervention. Ongoing choices of preferred items resulted in reductions in mouthing, even in the presence of the establishing operation.

Teaching students with combined behavioral disorders and mental retardation to lead their own IEP meetings;Snyder, E.P.;"For students with combined cognitive limitations and behavioral disorders (BD), postschool outcomes are poor; their lives are marked by a lack of independence and empowerment. A major goal of special education is to develop successful models to promote individual independence and empowerment for students. The individualized education program (IEP) planning meeting provides opportunities for students to develop critical skills for self-management, self-advocacy, goal setting, and choice making. This research extended the work of Snyder and Shapiro (1997) and examined the effectiveness of teaching adolescent students with mental retardation and BD to lead their own IEP meetings. Five students learned to (a) introduce others at their IEP meetings, (b) review their past IEP goals, (c) discuss their future IEP goals, and (d) close their meetings. The students rated the instruction as acceptable. Implications and limitations of the investigation are discussed.";2001;;Behavioral Disorders;27;4;340-357;;10.1177/019874290202700411;;#9701;Snyder 2001;
Examining the effects of teaching ninth grade students receiving special education learning support services to conduct own IEP meetings;Snyder, Edward Paul;Students with learning disabilities often experience problems associated with an inability to self-regulate their behavior to meet the social and educational demands needed to achieve success in school (Lerner, 1988). The individualized education program (IEP) of students with learning disabilities provides an opportunity to teach selfdetermination. Houck (1984) points out that the IEP addresses the unique needs and goals of students. Setting one's own goals has been shown to often result in increased personal responsibility, enhanced self-efficacy, and leads to more frequent attainment of these goals. Though numerous goals are contained in IEPs, student involvement in setting their IEP goals, even at the secondary level, is for the most part either nonexistent or passive. This study examined the effects of training students receiving special education learning support services to set goals through active participation in the development of their own IEPs across 13 students. Results showed that 12 students were able to demonstrate the behaviors needed for managing their own IEP under analogue and actual IEP meeting conditions. Grades collected for all students revealed they maintained a level of achievement following their IEP meeting that was similar to their level of achievement prior to leading their IEP meeting. The results of goal attainment scaling showed that 8 students performed near or an expected level of performance or better on goals set for academic subjects. Students did report higher self-efficacy ratings following training for IEP meeting participation. The training for IEP participation and IEP goal setting was rated by students as satisfactory, and teachers reported that student-led IEP meetings were acceptable. Limitations of this study and implications for future research are also discussed.

Interaction patterns between children and their teachers when using a specific multimedia and communication strategy: Observations from children with autism and mixed intellectual disabilities;"Tjus, Tomas; Heimann, Mikael; Nelson, Keith E.";Examined observed interaction patterns between 11 children with autism (mean age 9.3 yrs) and 9 children with mixed intellectual disabilities (mean age 13.1 yrs) and their 9 teachers working with a specially developed multimedia program to increase literacy skills. Results of observation over 3–4 mo shows there was an increase in verbal expression for the total group. The children with autism also showed increased enjoyment and willingness to seek help from their teachers. Teachers for both groups reduced instructions on how to handle the computer during the program, but the decrease was greater in the teachers for children with autism. When the total group subdivided according to language age (high vs low), it appeared that those with a low language age showed an increase in verbal expressiveness from start to end of training. Those with a high language age showed increased enjoyment. It is concluded that more detailed studies of the interaction patterns between teachers and children are needed, and these should be related to children's language level as well as to diagnostic group.

Adaptations of fast mapping for vocabulary intervention with augmented language users;"Wilkinson, K.M.; Albert, A.";"Over the past 20 years, a phenomenon called ""fast mapping"" has received considerable attention as a potential explanation for the rapid vocabulary expansion typically observed in the preschool years. It has been proposed that children learn new words rapidly by sketching quick, incomplete maps of word meanings after only very few exposures to the word. Recently, several authors have suggested that adaptations of procedures used to explore fast mapping might be useful as an intervention tool for individuals with limited vocabulary associated with developmental delays. This article describes successful adaptation of fast mapping for teaching sight word recognition with two participants with cognitive and communication limitations. Important variations that were necessary to match teaching procedures to learning styles are highlighted across the two participants.";2001;;AAC: Augmentative and Alternative Communication;17;2;120-132;;10.1080/aac.17.2.120.132;;#9707;Wilkinson 2001;

Use of a structured descriptive assessment methodology to identify variables affecting problem behavior;"Anderson, Cynthia M.; Long, Ethan S.";This study evaluated a variation of functional assessment methodology, the structured descriptive assessment (SDA). The SDA is conducted in an individual's natural environment and involves systematically manipulating antecedent variables while leaving consequences free to vary. Results were evaluated by comparing the results of an SDA with results obtained from an analogue functional analysis with 4 children who exhibited problem behavior. The participants were an 8 yr old boy with autism and moderate to severe mental retardation, a 13 yr old girl with Down syndrome and profound mental retardation, a 13 yr old boy with moderate to severe mental retardation, and a 6 yr old boy with autism. For 3 of 4 participants, the results of the two assessments suggested similar hypotheses about variables maintaining problem behavior. Interventions based on the results of the SDA were implemented for 3 children and resulted in significant reductions in rates of problem behavior.

The effect of an idiosyncratic stimulus on self-injurious behavior during task demands;"Carey, Yvonne A.; Halle, James W.";Investigated the influence of a potential establishing operations (EO) on the self-injurious behavior (SIB) of a 12-year-old male with severe mental retardation. This study was conducted in two phases: functional analysis and treatment. Results of the functional analysis indicated that SIB was maintained by escape from demands and access to an activity (listening to music). In the treatment phase, the authors examined the effects of the presence and absence of music, a putative EO, on SIB during the demand condition. Results indicated that the presence of music was correlated with a reduced rate of SIB during the demand condition. Some possible mechanisms by which music affected SIB are discussed.

The effects of simultaneous prompting on teaching receptively identifying occupations from picture cards;"Dogan, Osman Senai; Tekin-Iftar, Elif";A multiple probe across subjects design was used to examine whether or not the use of simultaneous prompting procedure would result in an increase on the percentage of correct responding of receptively identifying occupations from picture cards. Maintenance and generalization effects of simultaneous prompting were also investigated. Five occupations were taught to each subject. Black and white picture cards were used to explain occupations during full and daily probe, instructional and maintenance probe sessions. Colored picture cards were used during generalization sessions and generalization probe was assessed before and after instruction. Maintenance sessions were conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the instruction. Simultaneous prompting was effective for teaching receptively identifying occupations from picture cards. Maintenance and generalization effects of simultaneous prompting were also positive. Future research is needed to extend the current literature about simultaneous prompting.

Concurrent reinforcement schedules: Behavior change and maintenance without extinction;"Hoch, Hannah; McComas, Jennifer J.; Thompson, Andrea L.; Paone, Debra";The authors evaluated the effects of concurrent schedules of reinforcement on negatively reinforced problem behavior and task completion with 2 children with autism, aged 9 and 11 yrs, and a 10 yr old boy with health impairments related to vision, hearing impairments, mild to moderate mental impairments, and language impairment. Results indicated that problem behavior occurred at high levels and relatively few tasks were completed when problem behavior produced a break (from tasks) and task completion produced either no consequence or a break. By contrast, problem behavior was eliminated and tasks were completed when problem behavior produced a break and task completion produced a break with access to preferred activities. Treatment gains were maintained without the use of extinction when the response requirement was increased and the schedule of reinforcement was thinned.

Effects on stereotypy and other challenging behavior of matching rates of instruction to free-operant rates of responding;"Johnson, J.W.; Van Laarhoven, T.; Repp, A.C.";Research has shown that when individuals are in situations that do not occasion one form of motoric responding, they will engage in another so that the overall level of motoric responding is homeostatic. The purpose of this study was to test whether students would substitute task-related behaviors for stereotypic or other challenging behaviors when the opportunity for active responding did or did not match the level of motoric responding in a free-operant baseline. Four students with mental retardation participated. Results showed that they did substitute behaviors, with stereotypic and other challenging behaviors occurring 1.5-14 times as much in the Non-matched condition for the four students. Further analysis showed considerably more of these behaviors in passive than in active tasks (by a factor up to 21 times as much). Results were discussed in terms of homeostasis, functional assessment, and opportunities to improve educational behaviors. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effects of competing reinforcement schedules on the acquisition of functional communication;"Kelley, Michael E.; Lerman, Dorothea C.; Van Camp, Carole M.";The initial efficacy of functional communication training (FCT) was evaluated when problem behavior continued to produce intermittent reinforcement. A 9-yr-old male, a 10-yr-old male, and a 10-yr-old female who had been diagnosed with mental retardation participated. Results for 2 of 3 participants showed that FCT was most effective when problem behavior was also exposed to extinction, response blocking, or both.

Establishing reports of saying and doing and discriminations of say-do relations;"Luciano, Carmen; Barnes-Holmes, Yvonne; Barnes-Holmes, Dermot";"Investigated a new procedure for establishing accurate discriminations of delayed acts of saying, of doing and discriminations of say-do correspondence and non-correspondence with 3 developmentally delayed subjects (Ss; male and female; aged 11-15 yrs old). A corrective feedback procedure for incorrect discrimination responses, that involved multiple exemplars, was initially employed, but failed to establish most of the target discriminations for all 3 Ss. A near-errorless training intervention was subsequently employed that also involved multiple-exemplars. This training used 2 referents (1 for acts of saying and another for acts of doing) as prompts to produce accurate delayed reports of what they promise to do presently, and accurate delayed reports of what they did. Prompts were also used to indicate whether the say-do relations were the ""same"" in terms of correspondence or not the same in terms of non-correspondence. Prompts were subsequently eliminated. All 3 Ss demonstrated highly accurate reports of delayed saying, doing and say-do correspondence or non-correspondence discriminations in the absence of prompts and with novel stimuli. The results are discussed in terms of generalized classes of behavior.

External memory and verbalization in students with moderate mental retardation: Theory and training;"Rinaldi, Delphine O.; Hessels, Marco G. P.; Büchel, Fredi P.; Hessels-Schlatter, Christine; Kipfer, Nadine M.";Persons with moderate mental retardation were trained to use external memory strategies in order to overcome their working memory limitations. We expected that meta cognitive training would allow these individuals to use external memories and that this would be associated with higher recall. It was further hypothesized that the training would be more effective when combined with a short verbalization instruction. Verbalization of one’s own thinking and actions should support and reinforce strategic thinking and structure representation. Verbalization should also permit the participants to acquire or access meta-knowledge, one of the basic components postulated for transfer of strategies. Furthermore, performance in analogical tasks should be improved by transferring the use of external memory strategies. The results show that only some of the participants of the experimental group with and without verbalization used the external memory strategy after training. Those who did use the external memory strategy at posttest performed well with regard to recall performance. We concluded that an external memory strategy is required if the task memory load is high and that the memory performance depends on the use of an external memory aid. The problem of transfer to analogical reasoning tasks remained, most likely because how external memories could be used in such tasks was not made explicit, and did the tasks did not allow much use of external memories.

Pupil-made pictorial prompts and fading for teaching sight words to a student with learning disabilities;"Rivera, Mabel O.; Koorland, Mark A.; Fueyo, Vivian";A nine-year-old male student with learning disabilities exhibiting speech and language delays, reading below grade level, participated in the study. He was taught to illustrate his own picture prompt materials for learning basic sight words. The experimenters used a multiple probe design across word sets, shown on flashcards, as well as reading in context to evaluate treatment effectiveness. Illustrating word meanings by drawing a representative picture was first modeled for the participant. Subsequently, he was told word meanings, and he illustrated the remaining target words. The participant faded his self-made prompts by drawing illustrations, progressively reduced in size and color intensity, during remaining treatment sessions. Rapid acquisition and retention of the target words occurred. Social validation information indicates the participant and his teacher liked the treatment. Self-made prompt materials have implications for reducing teacher preparation time and for increasing individualization.

A comparison is made between a new technique (the Handle Technique), Integrated Picture Cueing and a Word Alone method. The results show that using a new combination of teaching strategies enables logographic symbols to be used effectively in teaching word recognition to children with severe learning difficulties who had previously failed to develop a sight vocabulary.

Acquisition of literacy skills by children with severe disability;"Basil, C.; Reyes, S.";Many students with autism, intellectual impairment, and multiple impairments experience difficulties in acquiring literacy skills. An intervention programme based on the multimedia software Delta Messages and a scaffolding approach was used with severely disabled children. They showed significant gains in sentence production through a whole-word selection strategy, which was targeted in the programme, and in the ability to synthesise and spell words, tasks that were not targeted in the reading instruction. This suggests that massed practice of self-initiated and meaningful literacy activities can promote the acquisition of literacy by students with severe disabilities and limited written language skills. © 2003, Sage Publications.

Use of functional assessment and a self-management system to increase academic engagement and work completion;"Brooks, Amy; Todd, Anne W.; Tofflemoyer, Sheri; Horner, Robert H.";This study investigates whether a functional relationship exists between self-monitoring with self-recruited reinforcement and an increase in both on-task behavior and assignment completion for a 4th grade student with Down's syndrome and mild mental retardation. The study further assesses whether self-monitoring with self-recruited reinforcement is associated with generalization of performance gains to untrained settings. Training in self-management procedures included systematic instruction of behavior and general case programming to promote generalization of skills. An ABCAC design was used to assess the effects of self-management procedures in the training setting, and a multiple-baseline-across-settings design was used to assess generalization effects. The results demonstrated that a functional relationship existed between self-monitoring with self-recruited reinforcement and an increase in on-task behavior and assignment completion. Generalization of self-management skills to novel school contexts varied. The role of self-management procedures in promoting generalization is discussed.

The specific research questions were (1) whether disequilibrium schedules would produce reinforcing effects if both the instrumental and contingent tasks were of moderate to low preference for the student; (2) how effects of disequilibrium schedules would compare with those of a teacher-generated contingency; and (3) what effects disequilibrium schedules would have with students who engage in non-task responding during the baseline period. Results suggest that disequilibrium schedules are effective when used with moderate to low-preference tasks. Results of the comparison with teacher-generated contingencies were mixed. Results do suggest that the presence of higher levels of non-task responding during the baseline period may affect subsequent effectiveness of disequilibrium schedules calculated from the baseline.

Discrimination training: A comparison of two procedures for presenting multiple examples within a fading and non-fading paradigm;"Laarhoven, Toni Van; Johnson, Jesse W.; Repp, Alan C.; Karsh, Kathryn G.; Lenz, Mark";"When teaching discriminations, many researchers and practitioners recommend presenting multiple examples of both the correct and incorrect stimuli. To test this suggestion, the authors compared two procedures for presenting multiple examples. In one, multiple examples across trials (ME, Across), one correct and one incorrect stimulus were presented each trial; examples then changed across trials. In another procedure, multiple examples within trials (ME, Within), three stimuli were presented each trial; examples again changed across trials. Two experiments were conducted to test these procedures. The first procedure used a non-fading program to teach discrimination; the second used a fading procedure. In the first experiment, 10 moderately mentally retarded persons (aged 10-20 yrs) were taught to identify words under these two procedures. The former procedure was superior in acquisition; the latter procedure, however, was better under generalization for most participants. In the second experiment (n = 7 moderately mentally retarded students; aged 10-21 yrs), the authors presented the two procedures within a fading paradigm. The results replicated those in experiment 1: ME, Across was better for acquisition, but ME, Within was better for generalization.

Increasing independent seatwork: Breaking large assignments into smaller assignments and teaching a student with retgardation to recruit reinforcement;"Wallace, Monica A.; Cox, Elizabeth A.; Skinner, Christopher H.";A withdrawal design was used to evaluate the effects of a multicomponent intervention on independent seatwork and student-teacher interactions in a student with mild mental retardation. During the intervention phase, long assignments were changed to multiple, briefer assignments. After completing each brief assignment, the student recruited social reinforcement and the next brief assignment from the teacher. Results showed that this procedure increased the amount of independent seatwork the student completed without decreasing accuracy levels. Interaction data suggested that the intervention decreased teacher disapprovals and did not require additional teacher time. The discussion focuses on applied implications of the current study and plausible causal mechanisms that account for the current findings.

Student-directed learning strategies to promote the progress of students with intellectual disability in inclusive classrooms;"Wehmeyer, M.L.; Hughes, C.; Agran, M.; Garner, N.; Yeager, D.";Student-directed learning strategies involve teaching students to modify and regulate their own behaviour. Teaching students to self-regulate behaviour has been identified as one means of promoting self-determination, and promoting and enhancing self-determination has become a valued outcome internationally. In addition, however, student-directed learning strategies could prove important for including students with disabilities in general education classrooms by reducing the student's dependency upon others in the classroom setting. Four students with intellectual disability were supported to select an educational goal on which they wanted to work and were taught to self-monitor their progress toward that goal in general education classrooms. Their progress toward the goal was evaluated through data collection activities and by using the Goal Attainment Scaling process. In general, students achieved their self-selected goals.

Teaching Letter-Sound Correspondence to Students with Moderate Intellectual Disabilities;"Flores, Margaret M.; Shippen, Margaret E.; Alberto, Paul; Crowe, Lee";This study examined the efficacy of systematic and explicit instruction in phonic decoding for 6 elementary students with moderate intellectual disabilities. A multiple probe across behaviors with embedded changing conditions design was employed in order to analyze the effect of Direct Instruction on teaching the following skills with regard to consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words: letter-sound identification, continuous sound blending, sounding out, and decoding (sounding out then telescoping). One student did not master the letter-sound correspondences. The remaining 5 students mastered all of the instructed items in letter-sound identification, continuous sound blending, sounding out, and the decoding of CVC words. In addition, all 5 students demonstrated a generalized understanding of letter-sound correspondence and a generalized skill in sounding out untaught words. However, only 2 students were able to fully decode (sound out then telescope) untaught words. These findings provide evidence that Direct Instruction techniques can be used to teach letter-sound correspondence and decoding to some students with moderate intellectual disabilities. The results have implications for instructional methods and reading expectations for students with moderate intellectual disabilities.

A progressive delayed prompt training procedure was then implemented, with stimuli presented flat on the tabletop for one participant and at a 45° angle to the tabletop for the other participants. After 120 teaching trials, accuracy remained near chance. Next, a stimulus control shaping procedure was implemented using an adapted Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA), with stimuli at a 45° angle to the tabletop. Accuracy increased when this procedure was implemented with each stimulus pair in succession. In Experiment 2, for the participant whose stimuli were presented flat on the tabletop during the progressive delayed prompt training procedure, baseline trials were presented on the WGTA as at the end of Experiment 1, with differential reinforcement; accuracy remained high.

The Efficacy of Embedded Instruction for Students with Developmental Disabilities Enrolled in General Education Classes;"Johnson, Jesse W.; McDonnell, John; Holzwarth, Valarie N.; Hunter, Kimberly";A multiple baseline across behaviors design was used to evaluate the efficacy of embedded instruction with 3 students with developmental disabilities who were enrolled in general education classes. Two general education teachers and 1 paraprofessional delivered embedded instruction to students during regularly scheduled instructional activities. The skills taught to students included answering probe questions drawn from the general science curriculum, identifying functional sight-words drawn from the general reading curriculum, and making requests using an electronic communication device. Student data showed that embedded instruction was effective with all 3 students. The results also indicate that both general education teachers and paraprofessionals were able to implement the procedure with a high degree of fidelity without disrupting the ongoing instructional activities of the general education classes.

Learning Set Instruction in Seriation and the Oddity Principle for a Child With Severe Mental Disabilities;"Pasnak, Robert; Maccubbin, Elise M.; Campbell, Jessica L.; Gadzichowski, Marinka";"In a multiple baseline design, a teenager with a mental age of four years was taught two abstractions. One was the oddity principle (selecting the one object in a group which differs from the rest). The other was seriation (aligning objects along a continuum of size, and inserting new objects into their proper places in the alignments). These abilities demarcate the transition between preoperational and concrete operational thought, and are the earliest forms of purely relational responding. Learning sets of 80 oddity problems and 65 seriation problems were used to promote generalization. A ""fade-out"" procedure was used to make mastery of the problems as easy as possible. Combination of these techniques produced the first recorded success in teaching either the oddity principle or seriation to a child with severe disabilities, and may substantially reduce difficulty of helping many such children learn concepts at this level of abstraction.

Effects of a school-based program on physical function and work productivity in individuals with mental retardation;"Seagraves, F.; Horvat, M.; Franklin, C.; Jones, K.";"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a school-based physical education progressive resistance-training program on physical functioning and work productivity in individuals with mental retardation. Fourteen high-school participants were matched according to age, gender, height, and weight and then randomly placed into treatment and control groups. Treatment groups participated in a resistance-training program while the control group participated in group and individual games. Both programs were 10 weeks in duration at a frequency of twice per week. Vocational and strength assessments were collected at all three 5-week intervals plus a retention assessment. Peak isometric strength was assessed bilaterally using a hand-held dynamometer at the following sites: elbow flexion, elbow extension, shoulder abduction, knee flexion and knee extension, which were summed to create composite scores for the upper and lower body. Vocational assessments were representative of typical job skills for this population and consisted of a dolly push, pail carry, box stacking, and chair stacking. After termination of the treatment intervention at 10 weeks, a retention assessment was administered 5 weeks after cessation of training. Based on the data analysis, a significant difference was found for all vocational tasks (chair stacking, F1,6 = 9.79, p = .010; pail carry, F1,6 = 4.65, p = .037; dolly push F 1,6 = 4.89, p = .018; box stacking F1,6 = 4.85, p = .035) with resistance training participants displaying higher mean scores than participants in control groups. In addition, percentage change data for isometric strength composites with treatment groups increased an average of 25.1%. Based on the retention data, mean percentage change for all participants in the training group decreased towards initial levels of functioning for isometric strength and vocational tasks. It was concluded that the school-based physical education training program was effective in increasing physical functioning and work-related skills, which can facilitate the school to work transition process.";2004;;Clinical Kinesiology;58;2;18-29;;;;#9085;Seagraves 2004;
Assistive technology programming for a young child with profound disabilities: A single-subject study;"Shull, J.; Deitz, J.; Billingsley, F.; Wendel, S.; Kartin, D.";Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use single-subject research methods, combined with social validation procedures, as part of an evaluation/intervention process exploring the effects of adapted switch-operated devices on self-initiated behaviors of a 6-year-old child with profound multiple disabilities. Method: A single-subject withdrawal design with multiple phases, including one alternating treatments phase, was used to investigate the participant's ability to perform selective, voluntary motions as indicators of contingency awareness and preferences. Social validity also was assessed. Results: The child demonstrated the ability to use two switch sites to activate adapted switch-operated devices when a preferred stimulus was contingent on a specific motor action, and she demonstrated the ability to communicate preferences as indicated by more frequent switch activations for one consequence than for a second consequence. Social validity results indicated that both the parents and school personnel generally viewed the evaluation/intervention process as positive. Conclusions: Single-subject research methods, combined with social validation procedures, can be used effectively in the evaluation/intervention process for children with profound multiple disabilities. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Teaching students with developmental disabilities to locate their AAC device;"Sigafoos, J.; O'Reilly, M.; Seely-York, S.; Edrisinha, C.";Students with autism and related developmental disabilities who do not speak are often taught to use some type of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) system, such as a voice output communication aid (VOCA). One problem with such devices is that the person may be unable to communicate when the device is not readily accessible. We first taught three nonverbal students with autism to use a VOCA to request access to preferred items. Following this initial acquisition phase, however, none of the students would locate their VOCA when it was not within reach. A least-to-most prompting procedure was implemented to teach the students to locate their AAC device. The effectiveness of this procedure for teaching VOCA location skills was evaluated in a delayed multiple-baseline across subjects design. The results showed that the intervention was effective in teaching the students to locate their AAC device when they needed it to request access to preferred objects. Teaching VOCA location skills may be a useful and necessary component in AAC interventions for some people with developmental disabilities. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Self-Monitoring to Increase Following-Direction Skills of Students with Moderate to Severe Disabilities in General Education;"Agran, Martin; Sinclair, Thomas; Alper, Sandra; Cavin, Michael; Wehmeyer, Michael; Hughes, Carolyn";We used two multiple baseline designs to investigate effects of a self-monitoring strategy on following-direction skills of six middle school students with moderate to severe disabilities in general education. Students were instructed to acknowledge a given direction, complete the task, and monitor their performance. Results suggest that all students learned the strategy and maintained their performance at mastery levels for the duration of the maintenance condition. Social validation data obtained from participating general and special educators supported these findings. Implications for promoting student-directed learning and inclusive education are discussed.

Adjunctive role for immediate feedback in the acquisition and retention of mathematical fact series by elementary school students classified with mild mental retardation;"Dihoff, R.E.; Brosvic, G.M.; Epstein, M.L.; Cook, M.J.";The effects of feedback on the acquisition and retention of mathematical fact series by elementary school students classified with mild mental retardation was examined in 4 studies. Immediate feedback was provided by either an educator or the Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique (IF AT), at the end of a test series by a review of correct solutions (delayed feedback), or for control purposes, with a Scantron form. Reductions in errors and inaccurate perseverative responding during intervention periods were higher, and the repetition of errors during maintenance test was lower, when feedback was provided by an educator in Study 1. These results were replicated and extended in Study 2 to the operation of subtraction. In Study 3, the concurrent presentation of both forms of immediate feedback was more effective than the presentation of either form separately. In Study 4, the adjunctive value of the IF AT to facilitate the teaching-learning process was established, with higher levels of independent learning and retention demonstrated when the IF AT was available. The IF AT, as a simple paper and pencil tool, can assist the educator through the provision of individualized performance feedback and the encouraging of students to continue responding while simultaneously promoting independent learning.;2005;;Psychological Record;55;1;39-66;;10.1007/BF03395497;;#9020;Dihoff 2005;
Learning to read against all odds: Using precision reading to enhance literacy in students with cognitive impairments, extreme academic deficits, and severe social, emotional, and psychiatric problems;"Freeze, Rick; Cook, Paula";"The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and practicality of precision reading, a constructive reading intervention, with students with cognitive impairments, extreme academic deficits in reading, and severe social, emotional, and psychiatric problems. As precision reading had shown promise with students with low achievement, learning problems, and learning disabilities (Freeze, 2000; Freeze, 2002c; Updike & Freeze, 2001), it was hoped that it might enhance the literacy skills of students with more severe disabilities who had experienced little success with either traditional reading instruction or prior remedial reading interventions. The usefulness of precision reading for seven students in a self-contained special education learning assistance and behaviour support program, located at an inner city elementary school in a western Canadian city was explored. The students in the study made statistically and educationally significant gains of between 0.9 and 1.1 years, in grade equivalency scores, on a standardized reading test in the areas of oral reading fluency, word recognition, and passage comprehension after five minutes of precision reading per day over thirty weeks. In addition, they made observable gains in self-confidence, motivation, and attitude. Recommendations for the use of precision reading with students with severe academic deficits in reading and negative attitudes towards learning are discussed. Limitations in the efficacy of precision reading also are reported. Overall, precision reading appears to be a powerful new tool educators can use to help the most difficult to reach and teach students to read.

Investigating the effect of self-monitoring on classroom organizational behaviors of students with learning disabilities in inclusive settings;Mcmullen, Rebecca Crocker;"A primary problem faced by students with learning disabilities (LD) in middle school, inclusive settings is students' lack of classroom organizational behaviors. Many of these individuals do not bring necessary materials to class, begin class on task, complete class work, copy homework assignments, or turn them in. General educators must become aware of interventions that close the gap between teacher expectations and students' ability levels. One effective intervention is self-monitoring. Many self-monitoring studies have addressed academic productivity and increasing on-task behaviors. However, this study addresses self-monitoring and classroom organizational behaviors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of self-monitoring on classroom organizational behaviors with students who have LD in inclusive settings. Using an ABAB reversal design embedded within a multiple baseline across two classrooms, the researcher investigated six sixth-grade students identified as having LD. These students were also viewed by their teachers as having organizational deficits. Students were instructed to self-monitor five organizational behaviors by circling yes or no to determine whether they completed them. One independent observer in each classroom collected data unobtrusively on each student. The study was guided by three research questions, which addressed the effectiveness of self-monitoring, the accuracy of self-ratings, and continuation of classroom organizational behaviors. Findings indicated the following: (1) when self-monitoring was introduced, students evidenced more classroom organizational behaviors; (2) they did not accurately assess their classroom performance with regard to these behaviors; and (3) they continued to perform the organizational behaviors in other inclusive settings. Results provide implications for using self-monitoring for adolescents with learning disabilities and organizational deficits.

Self-Management of Initiations by Students Diagnosed with Autism;"Newman, B.; Eyck, P. T.";"During prebaseline observations, three students diagnosed with autism were unable to make social initiations to another individual. The ability to make initiations would be considered a ""pivotal response"" in that it would allow an individual to come into contact with a wide variety of social reinforcement. A multiple-baseline design was implemented to measure the effects of a using a self-management package to teach the students to make social initiations. Two interventionists worked with each student to prompt and reinforce initiations. All students acquired social initiations during externally-determined reinforcement. The initiations were maintained when reinforcement changed from externally determined to a self-management system. The prompts to initiate and self-reinforce were faded over the course of the sessions. The use of self-management by the student led to less need for staff intervention. Implications from the literature are discussed. (Contains 1 figure.)";2005;01-01;Analysis of Verbal Behavior;21;;117-122;;;;#32340;Newman 2005;
The functional effect of teacher positive and neutral affect on task performance of students with significant disabilities;"Park, Sungho; Singer, George H. S.; Gibson, Mary";The study uses an alternating treatment design to evaluate the functional effect of teacher's affect on students' task performance. Tradition in special education holds that teachers should engage students using positive and enthusiastic affect for task presentations and praise. To test this assumption, we compared two affective conditions. Three teachers working with a total of 4 elementary-age students with severe disabilities presented discrete trial tasks in neighborhood public school settings. The teachers alternated their affect between a positive affective condition characterized by smiling, enthusiasm, and rising and falling voice inflection and a neutral affect condition characterized by a flat voice tone and inexpressive facial features. Three of the four students responded more accurately to instructional tasks when teachers presented task demands and praise using positive affect. A fourth student, however, performed worse under the positive affect condition. This student had a long history of problem behavior in instructional settings. Implications for assessment practices are discussed.

Promoting Independent Performance of Transition-Related Tasks Using a Palmtop PC-Based Self-Directed Visual and Auditory Prompting System;"Riffel, L.A.; Wehmeyer, M.L.; Turnbull, A.P.; Lattimore, J.; Davies, D.; Stock, S.; Fisher, S.";This study examined the use of a palmtop computer running a software program by transition-age students with cognitive disabilities to increase independence on vocational and independent living tasks. The purpose of this research was to test the hypotheses that a palmtop computer utilizing a Windows CE platform with touch screen capabilities and programmed with the Visual Assistant program would (a) decrease the need for external prompts from the instructor, (b) increase the number of steps completed in a given task without external prompts, and (c) decrease the duration of time spent on each task for students with intellectual disabilities. Four students from a large suburban school district who were receiving special education services under the category of mental retardation were included in this research. Research was conducted using a multiple-baseline, across-participants design. Baseline, intervention, and follow-up data were collected on vocationally-oriented or life-skill tasks in the student's existing educational program. Upon completion of baseline data collection, students were taught to use the palmtop with the Visual Assistant program. In the computer-use condition, students required fewer instructor prompts to complete the tasks and increased the number of steps that they completed independently.

Effects of balance training on individuals with mental retardation;"Smail, K.M.; Horvat, M.";"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of balance training on functional tasks in individuals with mental retardation. Ten students participated in a balance program 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. Functional assessments were performed prior to commencing the intervention and after completion of the balance program. Balance measures were collected using the NeuroCom Equitest using the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), weight bearing squat and the step up and over. Data analysis indicated a significant difference in the SOT F(1,9) = 14.8, p<.01. This translated to a 25.8% increase from pre to post test. The weight bearing squat measured weight distribution at knee flexion 0° , 30° , 60° , and 90° . Pre test data indicated that participants were right side dominant 58.6% vs. 43.2% left side that improved on the post test to 51.9% right side and 48.1% left. Step up and over data supported the right side dominance, lift up index 56.73% right and 40.73% left; impact index 50.4% right and 50.33% left. Performance improved on the post test, lift up index 52.27% right and 47.33% left and impact index 50.4% right and 50.53% left.

Conditioning math as a reinforcer for performance and learning as a function of observation;O'Rourke, Christine A.;Two experiments were performed to test whether the acquisition of conditioned reinforcement would occur through observation. In Experiment 1, a pilot study was conducted as a replication of Greer and Singer-Dudek (2006), to investigate whether or not previously non-preferred tokens could be established as conditioned reinforcers for performance and learning as a function of an observational intervention. Two students with learning disabilities participated in the experiment which utilized an ABABA reversal design with pre and post-tests for performance tasks, and a multiple baseline across participants design for learning tasks. Experiment 2 was conducted as an extension of Experiment 1, and sought to test whether observational learning of conditioned reinforcement would extend to previously non-preferred activities, specifically independent engagement in mathematics. Experiment 2 also tested whether academic performance in mathematics would improve following reinforcement conditioning via observation. Four participants from second and third grade general education classes participated in the experiment. An ABABA reversal design with pre and post-tests was utilized to test for changes in reinforcement effects of math for performance tasks, and pre and post-test measures for learn units to criterion were used to test for changes in the rate of acquisition of math repertoires. A delayed multiple baseline across participants with replications across three learning tasks was utilized to test for changes in reinforcement effects of math for learning new math repertoires. Results of Experiment 1 showed that tokens were conditioned as reinforcers for performance and learning as a function of the observational intervention. Similarly, the findings of Experiment 2 showed that math activities were established as a conditioned reinforcer for both performance and learning as a result of observation. In addition, once the math activities were conditioned as a reinforcer, the rate of acquisition of new math repertoires improved slightly for 3 out of 4 participants. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the observational intervention was effective in establishing a shift in preference of activities, changing a previously non-preferred activity into a preferred activity. The findings of the study were discussed in terms of a new type of observational learning, observational learning of conditioned reinforcement.

Effects of embedded instruction versus discrete-trial training on self-injury, correct responding, and mood in a child with autism;"Sigafoos, J.; O'Reilly, M.; Ma, C.H.; Edrisinha, C.; Cannella, H.; Lancioni, G.E.";"Background: Embedded instruction and discrete-trial training are both recommended for teaching children with autism, but there is little research available comparing the two. The present study compared embedded instruction with discrete-trial training for a 12-year-old boy with autism. Method: An initial functional analysis indicated that the boy's self-injury was maintained by escape from task demands. Instructional sessions to teach adaptive behaviours were conducted under two conditions: (i) during embedded instruction, learning trials were inserted into ongoing activities at a rate of approximately 1.5 per minute; (ii) during discrete-trial training, instructional opportunities were incorporated into structured sessions at a rate of 4 per minute. In both conditions, the system of least prompts was used to teach relevant target responses. Effects of the two teaching formats were evaluated using an ABABA design. Results: Higher rates of self-injury and fewer correct responses occurred during discrete-trial training. Mood ratings were also lower during discrete-trial training. Conclusions: The results suggest that self-injury, correct responding, and mood may be sensitive to the type of instructional format. Although discrete-trial training can be highly effective, it may be preferable to start with embedded instruction when the child presents with self-injurious escape behaviour. © 2006 Australasian Society for the Study of Intellectual Disability Inc.";2006;;Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disability;31;4;196-203;;10.1080/13668250600999160;;#8607;Sigafoos 2006;

A Comparison of Two Strategies of Sight Word Instruction in Children with Mental Disability;"Van der Bijl, Corne; Alant, Erna; Lloyd, Lyle";The aim of this research study was to compare two strategies of sight word instruction in children attending a school for learners with moderate to severe mental disability, namely modified orthography (MO) and modified orthography where an association was made between the modification and the traditional orthography (MO/TO) together with a control group (TO). Thirty-three participants were matched according to their gender, receptive language skills and alphabet knowledge and assigned to the three groups, after which they were taught 10 sight words by using one of the above-mentioned strategies for 2 weeks. Word identification scores were obtained prior to teaching, on a daily basis during teaching, and after 3 weeks of withdrawal to determine the retention of identified words. Results show that individuals with moderate to severe mental disability are able to learn sight words through any of the three strategies implemented. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the three groups on a 5% level, significance on a 10% level was recorded for the MO/TO and TO groups. The order of effectiveness as measured by group averages on word identification was: MO/TO, TO and MO. The clinical implication of these results is that by using MO/TO as teaching strategy for sight words, individuals with limited literacy skills would be able to derive meaning from the written word while forming an association between the modification and the orthography. This could provide early reading success and enhance word identification.;2006;01-01;Research in Developmental Disabilities: A Multidisciplinary Journal;27;1;43-55;;;;#32359;VanderBijl 2006;

Vocabulary Instruction for Middle School Students with Learning Disabilities: A Comparison of Two Instructional Models;"Fore, Cecil, III; Boon, Richard T.; Lowrie, Kathryn";This study compared the effects of two types of instruction on the learning of content-area vocabulary words of six middle school students with learning disabilities. A multiple-baseline design across participants was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the two instructional models (i.e., definition and concept model) on the percent of vocabulary questions answered correctly. During the intervention condition, the concept model was implemented as the independent variable and compared with the definition model, the baseline. The concept model utilized a diagram encompassing the vocabulary word, the definition and characteristics, and examples and non-examples. In contrast, the definition model, which is more traditionally used by teachers, involved the students looking up and writing down the definitions of words and writing each word in a sentence. The dependent measure was the percent of vocabulary questions answered correctly after instruction, which indicated the degree of learning. Results showed that the concept model had a greater effect upon the learning of content-area vocabulary words than the definition model for all six of the students with learning disabilities. Limitations of the study, implications for teaching vocabulary instruction for classroom teachers, and future research questions are also discussed.

The impact of partner training on the communicative involvement of students with multiple and severe disability in special schools;"Foreman, P.; Arthur-Kelly, M.; Pascoe, S.";Background: The outcomes of a pilot program of staff development in communication support in the context of observed changes in student behaviour states and interactive abilities are reported. Participant reports about the impact of the program on their professional practices are included. Method: Six teachers and six teacher aides in special (segregated) schools were provided with a short, intensive training program designed to improve their communicative interactions with students with multiple and severe disability (MSD) in their classes. Behaviour state assessment was used for pre- and post-testing of six students. Teachers and aides completed self-report scales related to their communication skills, knowledge and concerns prior to and at the conclusion of the training program. Results: While staff reported improved skills and knowledge, this was not reflected in improvements in the communicative interactions of the students as observed in their classrooms. Conclusions: The training provided may not have been sufficient to change well-established teaching and interaction processes. Further research using in-school collaborative mentors is planned. © 2007 Australasian Society for the Study of Intellectual Disability Inc.;2007;;Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disability;32;4;233-247;;10.1080/13668250701654417;;#8367;Foreman 2007;

Integrated Word Identification and Communication Instruction for Students With Complex Communication Needs Preliminary Results;"Hanser, Gretchen A.; Erickson, Karen A.";The current study investigated the effectiveness of an integrated word identification and communication intervention for children with complex communication needs. Using a nonconcurrent, multiple baseline design, the study involved three participants who completed 75 lessons across 4 to 6 weeks of instruction. All three participants improved their skills of word identification, developmental spelling, icon sequencing, and expressive communication. Generalization was documented through increases in the frequency of communication using icon sequencing and spelling outside of the instructional program.

A Comparison of One-to-One Embedded Instruction in the General Education Classroom and One-to-One Massed Practice Instruction in the Special Education Classroom;"Jameson, J. Matt; McDonnell, John; Johnson, Jesse W.; Riesen, Tim; Polychronis, Shamby";A single subject alternating treatment design was used to compare the relative effectiveness of one-to-one embedded instruction in the general education classroom and one-to-one massed practice instruction in a special education class. Four middle school students with developmental disabilities, their special education teacher, and paraprofessional participated in the study. The results indicate that embedded instruction is an effective instructional strategy for students with developmental disabilities being served in inclusive settings. However, the results indicate that there was some difference in the efficiency of the two instructional formats. Two students reached criterion more rapidly in the one-to-one massed instructional intervention while the one-to-one embedded instruction was more efficient for one student. There was no difference between the interventions for the fourth student. Finally, the study validated previous research that found that both special education teachers and paraprofessionals can, with minimal training, accurately implement embedded instructional interventions in the general education classroom.

The participants were girls of 12.5 and 4.0 years of age who did not possess any specific response that they could profitably use in their environment. The study was conducted according to an ABAB design with a 3-week postintervention check. The results showed that both participants increased their level of responding during the intervention phases and postintervention check compared to the baseline phases. This positive outcome was discussed in terms of (a) the apparent suitability of the technology and responses used in the study, (b) the beneficial implications for the participants, and (c) new developments in the area.

Using Teacher Prompts and Habit Reversal to Reduce Fingernail Biting in a Student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and a Mild Intellectual Disability;"Waller, Raymond J.; Kent, Susan; Johnson, Miriam E.";Fingernail biting is a habit that is developed by numerous people, especially children and teenagers. Many clinicians believe that the habit of fingernail biting stems from nervousness or anxiety. Students, especially students with disabilities, can be easily distracted from instruction, can become the target of negative peer attention, and can get socially ostracized by habit problems such as fingernail biting. Although teachers often must prioritize severe behavioral problems that we see in the classroom, we think that teachers have dramatically improved the quality of life of some of our students by helping them to modify other, less severe behavioral issues like fingernail biting. This study investigated the effect of the simple, noninvasive, and nonpunitive approaches of using coded verbal prompts and habit reversal to reduce fingernail biting in a classroom setting. A significant reduction was observed. (Contains 1 figure.);2007;07-01;TEACHING Exceptional Children Plus;3;6;1-10;;;;#29762;Waller 2007;
The effect of classical music on painting quality and classroom behaviour for students with severe intellectual disabilities in special schools;"Waugh, R.F.; Riddoch, J.V.";"There are few studies measuring the effects on painting quality of playing background classical music at special schools.

Guttman scales were created to measure both quality of painting and, separately, classroom behaviour, weekly, for six consecutive weeks. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA (General Linear Model, repeated measures with SPSS) found: (1) that interaction effects did not reach significance; (2) a significant main effect for method of teaching on painting quality, and on classroom behaviour, with the Pictorial and Classical Music method being significantly better; (3) a significant main effect for practice over the six weeks on painting quality, with the Pictorial and Classical Music method being significantly better; and (4) a non-significant main effect for practice over the six weeks on classroom behaviour.

Using a high probability command sequence to increase classroom compliance: The role of behavioral momentum;"Belfiore, P.J.; Basile, S.P.; Lee, D.L.";One of the most problematic behaviors in children with developmental disabilities is noncompliance. Although behavioral research has provided strategies to impact noncompliance, oftentimes the methodologies are consequent techniques, which may not be conducive to implementation by the classroom teacher. In this teacher-designed and implemented study, a sequence of high-probability instructional commands preceded the targeted low-probability command, in an attempt to increase compliance to the low-probability command. Results, discussed within the body of behavioral momentum research, showed an increase in compliance to low-probability classroom commands for a seven year-old student with moderate mental retardation and Down Syndrome. Results are discussed as (a) an effective, antecedent approach to classroom compliance and (b) re-connecting the gap between applied behavioral research and experimentally controlled classroom practice. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;2008;;Journal of Behavioral Education;17;2;160-171;;10.1007/s10864-007-9054-x;;#8232;Belfiore 2008;

Teaching Elementary Students with Multiple Disabilities to Participate in Shared Stories;"Browder, Diane M.; Mims, Pamela J.; Spooner, Fred; Ahlgrim-Delzell, Lynn; Lee, Angel";Literacy may be one of the most important instructional areas for enhancing quality of life for all students. One way to promote literacy skills is through engaging students in the shared reading of a story. In this study, methods for planning and implementing shared stories for three students with multiple disabilities was evaluated via a multiple probe design across participants. Because the students had few consistent responses and complex physical challenges, a team planned the literacy participation using principles of universal design for learning (UDL). Outcomes indicate that all three students improved literacy skills and added to the literature base that shared stories can promote early literacy.

The effects of video modeling on leisure time activities for learners with severe special needs;Farr, Wendy;Video modeling is a technique that can be used to provide instruction for acquiring the skills put forth in leisure education and is an innovative and expanding medium, yet current research warns that minimal empirical evidence is available that documents the effects of this intervention. Research that does exist targets elementary aged students with mild to moderate disabilities. In this study, special education staff used video modeling in their classroom to teach three individuals with autism to improve their behavior, choice making, and overall task independence. The participants in this student were between the ages of 17-20 and were diagnosed with autism and severe mental retardation. The researcher found support for the use of video modeling to reduce inappropriate behaviors, improve choice making, and increase overall levels of independence during leisure tasks.

Using Teacher and Researcher Data to Evaluate the Effects of Self-Management in an Inclusive Classroom;King-Sears, Margaret E.;A student with moderate mental retardation included in a general education math setting was taught how to use self-management to increase his on-task behaviors. A researcher and special educator worked together to determine the content for self-management, and each collected 2 different types of data to monitor the impact of self-management. Results indicated (a) a correlation between the researcher's and teacher's data and (b) that self-management was effective for increasing the student's on-task behaviors and decreasing the amount of time it took for him to begin tasks.

Assessing the effectiveness of the response to instruction model for English language learners by utilizing a non-language-based intervention;Komatsu, Chisato;The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the use of the Response to Intervention (RTI) model for English Language learners (ELLs) by using a computerized constant time delay procedure (CTD) that de-emphasized the use of language. Forty-five ELLs, 22 native English speakers, and five students with a diagnosis of mild mental retardation participated in the study. A computer-administered CTD procedure was utilized for paired associate tasks. The study found differences and patterns in students' performances that could be used to differentiate responders and non-responders to intervention. An interesting finding was that once the students were divided into groups based on their performance, there was no difference found between the population groups (i.e., ELLs, native English speakers, and students with mental retardation). By assessing the students' responses to intervention with a non-language-based intervention, the study provided useful information for the establishment of a non-discriminative, efficient, and practical approach for assessment with ELLs.

Exploring the Effectiveness of Phonics-Based Instruction for Children with down Syndrome;Lemons, Christopher J.;"Practitioners are increasingly expected to provide reading instruction to students with cognitive disabilities to help them become literate. Whereas a phonics-based approach to reading instruction is regarded as a ""best practice"" for most young children, its effectiveness for children with cognitive disabilities is unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore this issue for a sample of 24 children with Down syndrome (DS) between the ages of 7 and 16 years and to model individual children's reading growth to identify specific child characteristics predictive of this growth. Results indicate that a majority of children demonstrated statistically significant growth in letter sounds, and reading of taught sight words and decodable words. Children with DS who entered the study with more advanced word identification skills made greater gains in decodable word reading; those with more advanced phoneme segmentation skills made greater gains in nonsense word reading. Overall, findings support inclusion of phonics-based reading instruction into academic programs for children with DS.

Using a system of least prompts procedure to teach telephone skills to elementary students with cognitive disabilities;"Manley, K.; Collins, B.C.; Stenhoff, D.M.; Kleinert, H.";Using the telephone to contact others can be an important skill in maintaining friendships with peers. This investigation used a system of least prompts (SLP) procedures to teach two telephone skills to 3 elementary students with cognitive disabilities: (a) placing phone calls and (b) leaving recorded voicemail messages. The SLP procedure was effective in teaching both skills to all 3 students.

Teachers Make It Happen: From Professional Development to Integration of Augmentative and Alternative Communication Technologies in the Classroom;Mcmillan, Julie M.;This study investigated the effects of a multiphase teacher professional development package on student use of speech-generating augmentative and alternative communication devices (SGDs). Teachers were taught (a) device operation and programming, (b) device integration and embedding using environmental arrangement strategies, and (c) systematic communication instruction using the time-delay milieu teaching procedure, within a multiple baseline design across student and teacher participants. All four teachers learned device programming and instructional procedures, and generalised as well as maintained their use. There was no effect on student SGD use during phase 1, device operation. However, all four students showed significant increases in SGD initiations during phase 2, environmental arrangement and embedding, and SGD initiations remained at high levels through phase 3, time-delay. For two students with significant disabilities, SGD initiations increased further during phase 3. All students generalized and maintained use of their SGDs for at least two months following termination of teacher professional development. This study has major implications for teacher professional development in assistive technology and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) integration in the classroom for students with severe disabilities. Without sufficient training and support, important student outcomes such as increased participation and communication initiations for device users are unlikely to be achieved. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that measurement of student outcomes is a critical component of evidence-based professional development practices.

Comparison of Static Picture and Video Prompting on the Performance of Cooking-Related Tasks by Students with Autism;"Mechling, Linda C.; Gustafson, Melissa R.";This study compared the effectiveness of static photographs and video prompts on the independent task performance of six young men with a diagnosis of autism. An adapted alternating-treatment design with baseline, comparison, withdrawal, and final treatment conditions was used to measure the percentage of cooking-related tasks completed independently by each student across the two treatments. Both procedures were effective in increasing correct task performance for all participants from baseline levels where only verbal task directions were provided. However, participants independently completed a greater number of tasks when using video prompting. During the final treatment phase, each student further increased his level of performance when using video prompting with sets of tasks receiving static picture prompts during the comparison phase.;2008;01-01;Journal of Special Education Technology;23;3;1-2;;;;#31229;Mechling 2008;
Teaching High School Age Students with Special Needs the Four Situations for Subtraction;"Miller, Karen A. Donk; Rule, Audrey C.; MacEntee, Virginia M.";"All learners, including those who qualify for special education services, should have access to learning mathematical concepts. This study examined the efficacy of using hands-on sets of materials to teach two high school students with mental retardation the four situations for subtraction. This is a mixed methods study using a simple pretest-posttest design to determine correct interpretation of subtraction story problems for different situations (take-away, comparison, completion, and whole-part-part) and correct regrouping during dynamic subtraction. Eight story problems were presented to the two participants eight weeks prior to instruction; students answered an identical posttest after twelve half-hour lessons on subtraction story problems and regrouping, which occurred during a two-and-a-half week period. Qualitative teacher observations of the two students were used to triangulate the data. On the pretest, students scored poorly, with one student completing none of the eight items correctly and the other completing three. The non-take-away subtraction situations confused the students and they made many regrouping errors during dynamic subtraction. On the posttest, both students solved all the problems correctly. Teacher observations indicated that students found the hands-on materials engaging and motivating, using the manipulative's to help them during regrouping. The materials and method of teaching were effective for the following reasons: the sets of objects suited the concrete developmental stage of the students; a variety of colorful and exciting materials were used to pique and sustain student interest; the teacher modeled and verbally explained how to solve the problems using the hands-on materials; the teacher encouraged interaction and elicited students explanations; and students were moved from the concrete manipulative's to the more abstract nature of word problems. The authors recommend that these materials not only be used with primary grade students to teach subtraction situations, but with other students with special needs (19 references; 2 tables, one containing photographs of materials and the other showing the pretest/posttest questions).";2008;02-10;Online Submission;;;1-10;;;;#26844;Miller 2008;

A Spanish intervention programme for students with special education needs: Effects on intellectual capacity and academic achievement;"Pérez, L.F.; Beltrán, J.A.Jesús A.";The purpose of the study was to determine whether the application of a school intervention programme based on the theory of multiple intelligences improves the academic achievement of students with low intellectual capacity, and whether the intervention programme also improves their level of general intelligence. The assessment design is quasi-experimental, with a non-equivalent control group, and with pre- and post-treatment measurements. The independent variable is the administration of the programme and the dependent variables are participants' intellectual capacity and academic achievement in subject matters considered essential in the curriculum - mathematics, language and social sciences. The study was carried out with 113 students aged between 11 and 16 years. The results show that the project has fully achieved the proposed goals, contributed to scientific knowledge about the development of intelligence and shown that the teaching of processes is one of the most effective methods to increase academic learning. Significant improvements were observed in learning and in intellectual capacity.;2008;;European Journal of Special Needs Education;23;2;147-156;;10.1080/08856250801947846;;#8244;Pérez 2008;

A Pilot Study to Determine the Efficacy of a Social Story [TM] Intervention for a Child with Autistic Disorder, Intellectual Disability and Limited Language Skills;"Reynhout, Georgina; Carter, Mark";Social Stories[TM] have gained wide acceptance as an intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) yet extant research provides only circumscribed empirical evidence in support of their efficacy. While it is claimed that Social Stories may be appropriate to children with significant levels of intellectual disability and basic language skills, limited research has been conducted with this group. This pilot study employed an ABC design using a Social Story intervention to target looking at a book during group reading time. The participant was a child with autistic disorder who had intellectual disability and limited language skills. The intervention was unsuccessful, highlighting the need to further investigate the role that both language skills and intellectual ability play in moderating response to the intervention.

The Effects of Peer-Assisted Sentence-Combining Practice on Four Young Writers with Learning Disabilities;"Saddler, Bruce; Asaro, Kristie; Behforooz, Bita";"Constructing well-formed sentences is an important element of writing. However, many students struggle with this skill; in particular, writers with learning disability (LD). In this study sentence-combining practice with a peer-assistance component was used to improve the ability of four young students with LD to construct sentences and compose stories. Results support the use of sentence-combining practice to increase sentence-construction ability. Furthermore, sentence-combining instruction led to gains in story quality, use of taught constructions, and number of revisions. We also targeted transfer of the sentence-combining skills to story writing by integrating generalization training via parallel writing tasks and a Peer-Editor Checklist. Student comments suggested that the checklist increased their ability to identify the use of sentence-combining skills in each other's writing and make effective revising suggestions.

Evidence-Based Practice in the Classroom: Evaluating a Procedure for Reducing Perseverative Requesting in an Adolescent with Autism and Severe Intellectual Disability;"Sigafoos, Jeff; Ganz, Jennifer; O'Reilly, Mark; Lancioni, Giulio";Management of inappropriate behaviour is a major priority in special education. Evidence-based practice dictates that interventions to reduce inappropriate behaviour should be evaluated at the individual level to demonstrate their efficacy in the classroom. This study illustrates the evaluation of an evidence-based procedure (response interruption) for reducing perseverative requesting in an adolescent boy with autism and severe intellectual disability. The boy used a speech-generating device to request snacks during baseline and response interruption conditions. During both conditions, the boy had to wait 30 seconds while the snack was being prepared. Requests that occurred during this wait interval were defined as perseverative. Intervention involved blocking perseverative requests and prompting the child to wait. An ABAB design was used to evaluate the effects of the response interruption procedure. The results demonstrated that response interruption effectively reduced perseverative requesting, while maintaining appropriate requesting at other times. The study illustrates how special educators might evaluate evidence-based practice in the classroom.

The effects of a leg strengthening program on the endurance run of adolescents with intellectual disabilities;Simbeck, Cathy Mohr;This study was conducted to determine the effects of a leg strengthening program on the 600 yd run/walk time of adolescents with intellectual disabilities (Fernhall & Pitetti, 2000). A single subject ABAB applied intervention analysis was replicated for each of 7 high school participants. Three males and 4 females were tested five times on the 600 yd run/walk and on a CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer for peak torque, peak force, and average force in each leg. BMI was also calculated and testing was conducted before and every 9 weeks following the two no treatment and two treatment phases. Between weeks 2 and 9 and weeks 20 and 27, the participants received no resistance or cardiorespiratory endurance (CRE) training. During weeks 11 and 18 and 29 and 36, the participants performed only leg strengthening resistance training exercises twice a week. All participants improved in leg strength as a result of the resistance training program in the amount of weight lifted and number of repetitions performed, as evidenced by the improvement on individual progress cards. In addition, varying amounts of improvements in peak torque, peak force and average force in extensors or flexors of either leg were seen in different participants following the leg strengthening programs. After Treatment 2, there was a sizeable mean decrease in BMI of 1.76 kg/m2 and a small mean decrease of 18 s in the 600 yard run/walk. Consistent with previous studies, the muscular strength and CRE of these participants with intellectual disabilities were considerably lower than peers without intellectual disabilities. Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that a progressive resistance training program can increase the leg strength of high school students with intellectual disabilities in as little as 2 days a week for 8 weeks. Although strong relationships were seen in BMI and leg strength and BMI and 600 yd run/walk, reliable relationships were not found between leg strength and 600 yd run/walk.

Increasing physical activity and self-determination for individuals with autism spectrum disorder;Todd, Teri;Despite the important benefits of physical activity, many people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty participating long enough to reap the rewards. Poor motor skills, difficulty planning movements, problems functioning in open environments, and low motivation combine to make sustained participation a challenge. This dissertation is a series of three studies designed to develop and assess intervention, based on self-determination theory, which promotes sustained physical activity for adolescents and young adults with ASD functioning at the low end of the spectrum. The studies were carried out at a high school for students with intellectual disabilities over three consecutive years. The results of studies and 2 were used to adapt the intervention to meet the needs of this population. Recent research has shown that when people act in a self-determined manner they become more engaged in what they are doing. The intervention for study I included one self-determination skill, self-monitoring. Goal-setting was added during study 2, this resulted in participants setting goals and self-monitoring as they walked and jogged. The intervention for the third study included 3 self-determination skills: goal-setting, self-monitoring, and self-reinforcement. The self-determination attitude of self-efficacy was measured during study 3 to better understand the relationship between self-efficacy and physical activity for individuals with ASD. Distance walked, jogged, or cycled, increased during studies 1 and 3. Visual methodologies were used during studies 2 and 3 to provide these participants with severe communication problems the opportunity to share their experiences during the physical activity with the researchers. Participants and teachers interpreted the facial expressions, which were captured with photographs, in terms of affect but their interpretations did not always match. The participants indicated that enjoyment of the activity increased over the duration of the physical activity program but this was not always obvious to the teachers. It was concluded that interventions which include self-determination skills increase engagement and enjoyment during physical activity for adolescents and young adults with ASD.

Effects of i write now strategy on high school students with significant cognitive disabilities' participation in composing an opinion paragraph;Trela, Katherine C.;Recent attention to curriculum reform in reading, math, and science in American schools has also raised equal concern about the need to strengthen writing curriculum for all students (NCW, 2003). These reforms have charged teachers of students with significant cognitive disabilities with delivering instruction aligned with general education curriculum and that follow NCTE's guidelines for improving writing instruction for all students. However, little research in evidence-based writing practices is available to guide such instruction. For this reason, strategies that support both access to general curriculum and progress toward individual skills to support that access are critical to high school teachers as they strive to align individual education program (IEP) goals with more complex academic standards. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of the I Write NOW strategy on writing opinion paragraphs with students with significant cognitive disabilities. A multiple probe across participants design was used to determine the effects of I Write NOW strategy instruction on number of opinion paragraph components chosen correctly in response to an adapted writing prompt. A functional relationship was shown between the strategy instruction and components chosen correctly. Findings from stakeholder surveys show that parents, students, and general education personnel found the instruction to be practical and meaningful to high school students. Results from the study, limitations, and suggestions for future research and practice are discussed.

The effect of schema-based instruction in solving mathematics word problems: An emphasis on prealgebraic conceptualization of multiplicative relations;Xin, Y.P.;The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a schema-based instructional strategy that emphasizes prealgebraic conceptualization of multiplicative relations on solving arithmetic word problems with elementary students with learning disabilities or problems (LP). Participants were 4 fifth graders with LP in a Midwestern urban public elementary school. An adapted multiple-probe-across-participants design was employed to assess the functional relation between the schema-based instructional strategy instruction and students' performance while solving word problems. The results of the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the schema-based instructional strategy with elementary students with LP. Introducing symbolic representation and algebraic thinking in earlier grades may facilitate a smoother transition from elementary to higher level mathematics learning and improve middle and high school mathematics performance.;2008;;Journal for Research in Mathematics Education;39;5;526-551;;;;#8160;Xin 2008;
Use of the behavioural approach in teaching counting for children with down syndrome;Abdelhameed, H.;This interventional study is concerned with the ability of twelve Egyptian children with Down syndrome to learn counting. Behavioural approach was used to teach these children to count number strings up to ten. The children were divided into three groups of four. The first group could not count at all, the second was able to count to three and the third could count to six. Observations were carried out before and after training to collect further information about their performance in counting, in a class context. According to the findings of the observation before training, children having difficulty in counting neither interacted properly with their teacher nor wanted to perform a counting task. Although, the children were at the earliest stages of the study, they were able to learn number strings to five or ten. They became competent in counting up to ten and the behavioural approach proved its effectiveness in teaching counting for children with Down syndrome.;2009;;International Journal of Special Education;24;2;82-90;;;;#11624;Abdelhameed 2009;
The efficacy of reciprocal teaching in fostering the reading literacy of students with intellectual disabilities;"Alfassi, M.; Weiss, I.; Lifshitz, H.";The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of strategy instruction on the reading literacy of students with mild and moderate intellectual disability. Students aged 15-21 with intellectual disability (n=35) participated in 24 sessions of literacy strategy instruction (experimental condition) or remedial literacy-skill acquisition- lessons (control condition). The main objective of strategy instruction was to foster comprehension monitoring. Through shared dialogues, students were trained to generate questions about text, to summarise what was read, to clarify difficult words and to make predictions. The strategies were taught using the reciprocal teaching method developed by Palincsar and Brown. This method involves provision of support adjusted to students' difficulties and peer teaching of strategies. Control subjects were exposed to direct instruction of basic reading skills that were presented sequentially and practiced solitarily by the students. Opportunities were given to respond to questions and to summarise but no strategy instruction was provided to foster comprehension monitoring. Two different measures of comprehension and a measure of strategy use were administered to test for variation across different methods of instruction. Findings on all measures provide support for the claim that strategy instruction is indeed superior to traditional remedial methods of skill acquisition in fostering reading literacy comprehension. These findings challenge the common perception that literacy is an organic impossibility for people defined as intellectually disabled. Moreover, the results add to recent research in sociocognitive instruction that supports the need to modify prevailing methods of reading curriculum and suggests a reconceptualisation of the comprehension process and its instruction to students with intellectual disabilities.;2009;;European Journal of Special Needs Education;24;3;291-305;;10.1080/08856250903016854;;#11488;Alfassi 2009;

Teaching children generalized imitation skills: A case report;"Brown Jackson, F.; Peace, N.; Parsons, R.";Generalized imitation plays an important role in the acquisition of new skills, in particular language and communication. In this case report a multiple exemplar training procedure, with an errorless learning phase, was used to teach Ben, a 13-year-old child with severe intellectual disabilities, to imitate behaviours modelled by an adult instructor. After exposure to seven multiple exemplars, Ben learned to imitate novel actions to criterion (i.e. generalized imitation). These skills were maintained at 90 percent at 6 week and 18 week follow-up. In line with earlier research, this article provides some further support for the finding that multiple exemplar training can facilitate the reliable emergence of generalized imitation skills. Topographically similar behaviours during the learning phase can be difficult to discriminate and hence can slow the learning process. Future research could explore how generalized imitation supports the development of basic communication and activity skills.;2009;;Journal of Intellectual Disabilities;13;1;9-17;;10.1177/1744629509103514;;#11469;BrownJackson 2009;

The Effects of Computer-Assisted Repeated Readings on the Reading Performance of Middle School Students with Mild Intellectual Disabilities;Cerasale, Mark William;The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 has mandated that all public school students will be reading at grade level by the 2013-2014 school year. Florida has embarked on an agenda to ensure that the kindergarten through high school student population is reading at or above grade level by 2014. Many of Florida's low-performing student population, including middle school students with high incidence disabilities, are reading below grade level. Using a multiple baseline across subjects design, this study examined the impact of computer-assisted repeated readings on the reading performance of three middle school students with mild intellectual disabilities over the course of 67 days. Results showed an improvement in reading fluency rate using instructional level text. The study was evaluated using quality indicators of single-subject research in special education. Future research is advocated to replicate this study across different grades and exceptionalities. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Effects of Direct Instruction on the Reading Comprehension of Students with Autism and Developmental Disabilities;"Flores, Margaret M.; Ganz, Jennifer B.";This study investigated effects of a Direct Instruction reading comprehension program implemented with students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and developmental disabilities (DD). There is little research in the area of reading comprehension for students with ASD and no research as to the effectiveness of reading comprehension Direct Instruction (DI). This study extended previous research by investigating the extent to which more complex instruction could be implemented with students with ASD and DD and its effect on their reading comprehension. A multiple probe across behaviors design was used. A functional relation between Direct Instruction and reading comprehension skills and behaviors was demonstrated across all behavioral conditions and across students. Data were also collected using curriculum-based assessments and all student demonstrated improvement. Results and their implications are discussed further.

Using a Time Timer™ to increase appropriate waiting behavior in a child with developmental disabilities;"Grey, I.; Healy, O.; Leader, G.; Hayes, D.";"This study aimed to examine the use of a predictive stimulus (Time Timer™) and delayed reinforcement to increase appropriate waiting behavior in a child with developmental disabilities and problem behavior maintained by access to tangible items and activities. The study employed a changing criterion design across settings to gradually increase reinforcement delay from 1 s to 10 min. Firstly a baseline phase was conducted to measure the duration of appropriate waiting behavior to access tangible reinforcers/activities. Phase 2 involved the use of a red cue card and the verbal instruction ""wait"". Phase 3 involved the introduction of the Time Timer™ with the cue card attached, and the verbal instruction ""wait"". Finally, Phase 4 utilised the Time Timer™ without the cue card. This method was an effective strategy for increasing appropriate waiting behavior with this participant in a school setting. The role of adding a concurrent activity during the reinforcement delay, using cues to predict reinforcement, future generalization, maintenance and the teaching of functionally equivalent skills are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of daily reading opportunities and teacher experience on adolescents with moderate to severe intellectual disability;Hatch, Penelope;The purpose of this study was examine the effect of providing daily access to a wide variety of age and ability appropriate texts to adolescents with moderate to severe intellectual disability. Forty-three adolescents were assigned to 2 groups based on their teachers' exposure to 40 comprehensive literacy lessons used in a previous study. Literacy gains were measured on an assessment of emergent literacy skills. A standardized reading measure was also used for 5 of the students who read at an early conventional reading level. Additionally, the number of different books that students read throughout the intervention was tracked using a student book log and compared to performance on a proxy measure of wide reading, a title recognition test. Paired samples t-tests yielded statistically significant gains on the posttest performance of emergent literacy skills for all students and on a standardized reading assessment for the 5 students who read at an early conventional level. To further examine student performance between the 2 groups, effect sizes were calculated. Results indicated that while both groups achieved a small effect, students whose teachers had exposure to the comprehensive literacy lessons received nearly twice the effect ( d = .36) as students whose teachers had not been exposed to the literacy lessons (d = .19). Furthermore, when students read at an early conventional level and were taught by teachers who had been exposed to the comprehensive literacy lessons, the effect of the intervention was even greater (d = .47). With regard to the number of different books that students read, results from a simple regression indicated that this variable was not predictive of student performance on the emergent literacy measure nor was it significantly correlated with performance on the title recognition test. Results of this study suggested that adolescents with moderate to severe intellectual disability benefit from daily access to age and ability appropriate books. When combined with instruction provided by teachers who had experience with comprehensive literacy instruction, the effect was even stronger. Furthermore, students who entered the intervention with early conventional reading skills made the greatest gains.

The Effects of the System of Least Prompts on Teaching Comprehension Skills during a Shared Story to Students with Significant Intellectual Disabilities;Mims, Pamela Joanne;"The development of literacy skills is a crucial skill that all students are entitled to develop (Browder, Gibbs, Ahlgrim-Delzell, Courtade, Mraz, Flowers, in press). Currently limited research has been conducted on the acquisition of early literacy skills for students with significant disabilities (Browder, Mims, Spooner, Ahlgrim-Delzell, & Lee, 2008; Browder, Trela, & Jimenez, 2007; Zakas, Browder, & Spooner, 2009) and even more limited on the acquisition of text dependent comprehension (Mims, Browder, Baker, Lee, & Spooner, in press). The current study examined the effects of the system of least prompts to teach multiple types of text dependent listening comprehension question during a shared story to students with significant intellectual disabilities. In addition, maintenance, generalization, and social validity were also examined. A teacher and two paraprofessionals were trained to implement a prompt hierarchy involving three levels (reread, model, physical) during three different shared stories with four different students. Results indicated that all four students increased the number of correctly answered comprehension questions during all three shared stories. In addition, students were able to maintain comprehension after a two week maintenance period. One student was able to generalize the skills used to develop comprehension during a shared story to the third book as well as an additional book. Finally, the interventionists reported high levels of satisfaction with the teaching strategy as well as student outcomes.

Tact Repertoires and Measures of Efficiency: Comparing the Effects of Two Behavioral Intervention Models with Students with Developmental Disabilities;Parker, Edward Donzell;"This dissertation reviewed experimental studies centering on the Lovaas Method (LovM), reviewed experimental studies centering on Verbal Behavior Approach (VBA) and/or studies that focused on the primary verbal operants, and compared the effects of LovM and VBA on the development of tact repertoires of three 11 to 12-year-old students with moderate to severe mental retardation. We administered the ABLLS-short form, determined current levels of performance, and implemented the protocols in an alternative school for students with developmental disabilities. Specifically, 10 targets from two categories were taught receptively to mastery criterion and then expressively to mastery criterion using the LovM, and ten different targets from the same categories were trained using VBA, which included transfer trials across operants. A within-subject alternating treatments with baseline design was used to evaluate skill acquisition and identify an optimal practice in regards to frequency of target operants mastered to criterion, measures of efficiency, maintenance, and generalization. The results of this investigation suggest that both protocols are effective in teaching receptive and tact target operants; however, across all participants, VBA resulted in fewer errors and was more efficient in teaching tact operants. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Improving the sequential time perception of teenagers with mild to moderate mental retardation with 3D immersive virtual reality (IVR);Passig, David;"Children with mental retardation have pronounced difficulties in using cognitive strategies and comprehending abstract concepts—among them, the concept of sequential time (Van-Handel, Swaab, De-Vries, & Jongmans, 2007). The perception of sequential time is generally tested by using scenarios presenting a continuum of actions. The goal of this study was to test whether the perception of sequential time among teenagers with mental retardation would improve, by using an intervention program employing 3D Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR). Eighty-seven teenagers with mild to moderate mental retardation, between the ages of 9 to 21, participated in the study. They were divided into three groups: a) an experimental group, who experienced sequential time scenarios in 3D IVR; b) one control group, who experienced the same scenarios via a series of two-dimensional (2D) pictorial episodes; and c) a second control group, who underwent no program of intervention. Our findings indicate that the participants who used the IVR program improved their time perception more than did the other members of the two control groups. In addition, the results reveal that the achievement required less moderation than executed with the control groups. Similarly, the results indicate that teens with mild retardation achieved a higher degree of sequential time perception than did those with moderate retardation.

A study of direct instructional spelling strategies and their effect on students with special needs who are classified with mild mental disabilities;Preast, Steven Douglas;Spelling is a challenging task for many individuals, especially for those classified as Mild Mentally Disabled. Although considerable literature exists in the areas of special education and spelling, little research is evident involving these two areas in combination. In an attempt to address this gap, the researcher conducted a single subject research study to investigate the hypothesis that direct instruction of spelling enhances the spelling skills of students with special needs. Perceptions of parents, students, and teachers on how this program impacted student spelling skills was also investigated. Quantitative data from this study was collected from the SRA Spelling Mastery Placement pretest and posttest spelling scores of six Mild Mentally Disabled students and were analyzed using an independent measures t test. Qualitative data were collected from parents, students, and teachers through field observations, questionnaires, and journals using specific protocols. Qualitative data was analyzed using an adapted open coding approach. Emergent themes included the link between spelling and sentence creation, the link between spelling and reading competency, successful lessons, non-successful lessons, and changes that promoted successful lessons. Quantitative results from the study indicated that direct instruction had a positive impact on the spelling abilities of students with Mild Mental Disabilities. The qualitative data revealed that parents, teachers, and students perceive direct instruction as a viable teaching methodology in the instruction of spelling. This study informs social change by providing an effective approach for spelling instruction for special needs students and by highlighting the positive role spelling has in increasing student’s reading and writing abilities.

Effects of a modified version of the self-directed IEP curriculum on student participation in their IEP meetings;Uphold, Nicole Marie;Post-school outcomes for students with significant cognitive disabilities are dismal. Several studies have found that students with higher levels of self-determination have better post-school outcomes. Students with significant cognitive disabilities have most commonly been directly taught self-determination skills through direct instruction. A way to indirectly teach self-determination skills is by teaching students to participate in the IEP process, including planning, drafting, and implementing the IEP, and leading the IEP meeting. The majority of studies that have taught students to lead their IEP meeting have included students with mild disabilities. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of a modified version of the Self-Directed IEP curriculum on students with significant cognitive disabilities ability to lead their IEP meeting. Findings showed a functional relationship between the curriculum and students ability to lead their IEP meetings.

Visual activity schedules: Teaching independent transitioning during recreation and leisure;"Whatley, Abigail D.; Gast, David L.; Hammond, Diana L.";This systematic replication and extension of Spriggs, Gast, and Ayres (2007) evaluated the use of visual activity schedule books on on-task and transitioning behaviors during recreation and leisure. Four middle school participants functioning within the moderate range of intellectual disabilities participated. Using a constant time delay procedure, participants were taught to use their visual activity schedule books and a withdrawal (A-B-BC-B-A-B) design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention. Incidental vocabulary words and pictures were presented via instructional feedback and evaluated using pre- and post-test. All participants increased on-task behaviors and independent transitioning when using visual activity schedule books. Participants also acquired incidental words and pictures.

The effectiveness of combining tangible symbols with the picture exchange communication system to teach requesting skills to children with multiple disabilities including visual impairment;Ali, Emad;"The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is an augmentative and alternative communication program (Frost & Bondy, 2002). Although PECS has been effectively used to teach functional requesting skills for children with autism, mental retardation, visual impairment, and physical disabilities (e.g., Anderson, Moore, & Bourne, 2007; Chambers & Rehfeldt, 2003), there are limited studies examining the effectiveness of PECS to teach requesting skills for children with multiple disabilities including visual impairment (Lund & Troha, 2008). This study explored the effectiveness of combining tangible symbols and other adaptations with PECS to teach requesting skills to students with multiple disabilities. Specifically, the participants were four students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment who also had many challenges in communication skills. The research design was the multiple probe design across subjects, a variation of a multiple baseline design. A notable benefit to this design is that there was no need to collect continuous recordings of baseline measures, because a strong a priori assumption of stability and the possibility of causing strong participant reactions existed before introducing the intervention. Instead, the researcher made periodic recordings of baseline levels to insure no significant changes have occurred before introducing the intervention. The study included four parts: (a) the assessment of reinforcers, (b) baseline, (c) the implementation of the intervention, which was teaching the three PECS phases and conducting generalization sessions, and (d) the maintenance condition. Three important research questions were posed: (1) Can students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment learn to make requests for preferred items using adapted PECS materials and procedures? (2) Can students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment generalize requesting skills for preferred items using adapted PECS from training rooms to classrooms? (3) Can students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment maintain requesting skills after training? The results indicated that all four participants learned requesting skills using adapted PECS, generalized the newly acquired skills to their classrooms, and maintained the requesting skills after training. Results of this study provided preliminary evidence that PECS with adaptations could be used effectively to teach requesting skills for students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment.

The authors trained participants to take and give 1 of 4 different types of messages (student gives message to person, immediate delivery; student gives message to person, delayed delivery; student calls person, immediate delivery; student calls person, delayed delivery). The dependent variable was the percentage of task-related steps completed. Results indicate that general case programming was an efficient and effective method for teaching participants how to take phone messages. In addition, all skills generalized to new messages in nontraining environments. For 3 participants, generality data were better for taught messages compared with new messages, and 1-month follow-up data showed maintenance of skill.

The effects of presession manipulations on automatically maintained challenging behavior and task responding;"Chung, Yi-Chieh; Cannella-Malone, Helen I.";This study examined the effects of presession exposure to attention, response blocking, attention with response blocking, and noninteraction conditions on subsequent engagement in automatically maintained challenging behavior and correct responding in four individuals with significant intellectual disabilities. Following a functional analysis, the effects of the four presession conditions were examined using multielement designs. Results varied across the 4 participants (e.g., presession noninteraction acted as an abolishing operation for 2 participants, but as an establishing operation for the other 2 participants). As such, both the results replicated and contradicted previous research examining the effects of motivating operations on automatically maintained challenging behavior. Although the results varied across participants, at least one condition resulting in a decrease in challenging behavior and an increase in correct responding were identified for each participant. These findings suggested that presession manipulations resulted in decreases in subsequent automatically maintained challenging behavior and simultaneous increases in correct responding might need to be individually identified when the maintaining contingencies cannot be identified.

The effects of peer-mediated embedded instruction on inclusive inquiry science for students with severe intellectual disabilities;Jimenez, Bree Ann;"There is a growing emphasis on meeting the diverse educational needs of all students which has drawn attention towards inclusive education. The number of students with severe disabilities receiving instruction in inclusive education settings has steadily increased over the past decade (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). Limited research has been conducted on the acquisition of grade-aligned science skills for students with severe disabilities (Browder et al., in press; Courtade et al., in press, Jimenez et al., in press), and even more limited on academic skills in inclusive settings (Carter et al., 2007; Dugan et al., 1995; Jameson et al., 2009).

Six general education peers were trained to implement an embedded constant time delay procedure during three science units with five students with severe disabilities. Results indicated that all five students increased the number of correct science responses during all three science units. In addition, all six peers were able to implement the intervention with high fidelity. Finally, high levels of social validity were reported by peers, as well as the general and special education teachers.

Whereas explicit, systematic reading instruction is effective at preventing reading difficulties for most young children, its effectiveness for children with intellectual disabilities remains unclear. The studys purpose was to explore this issue by identifying important child characteristics predictive of differential growth in targeted reading skills in response to a reading intervention that targeted phonological awareness, letter sound knowledge, and reading of decodable, sight, and nonsense words. One-on-one instruction was provided to 24 children with Down syndrome between the ages of 7 and 16 years. Results indicate that a majority of children demonstrated statistically significant growth on letter sounds, taught sight words, and decodable words. Children with Down syndrome who entered the study with more advanced word identification skills made greater gains in decodable word reading; those with more advanced phoneme segmentation skills made greater gains in nonsense word reading. Overall, findings suggest that incorporating elements of explicit, systematic reading instruction into interventions for children with Down syndrome may be beneficial for many. © 2010 International Reading Association, Inc.";2010;;Reading Research Quarterly;45;2;134-168;;10.1598/RRQ.45.2.1;;#11296;Lemons 2010;
Effects of Computer-Assisted Instruction on Students' Knowledge of Postschool Options;"Mazzotti, Valerie L.; Test, David W.; Wood, Charles L.; Richter, Sharon";Enhancing students' ability to make informed choices is an important precursor to successful choice-making, decision-making, and goal-setting. This study used a multiple-baseline design across behaviors replicated across participants to examine the effects of computer-assisted instruction on acquisition of students' knowledge of postschool options (i.e., employment, education, independent living). Results demonstrated a functional relationship between baseline and intervention for all four students. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

Evaluating the Use of a Self-Advocacy Strategy as a Means of Improving Progress in the General Curriculum for Individuals with Cognitive Disabilities;Schelling, Amy L.;The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the use of a self-advocacy strategy, with high school students identified as having a mild cognitive disability, would increase student use of self-advocacy skills across multiple school settings. Participants in the study were also identified as participating in at least one general education class at the time the study was conducted. A multiple baseline across participants and across settings design was applied to determine the effects of instruction on students' use of a self-advocacy strategy before and after the instructional period and across settings. Use and generalization of a self-advocacy strategy was measured across two separate conference meeting settings. Additionally, use and maintenance of behaviors related to self-advocacy were measured across the special and general education classroom settings. The data presented in the study shows that secondary students with a mild cognitive disability learned a self-advocacy strategy and were able to demonstrate use of the strategy across settings.

Using an extended automatic target acquisition program with dual cursor technology to assist people with developmental disabilities improve their pointing efficiency;"Shih, Ching-Hsiang; Shih, Ching-Tien; Chiu, Hsin-Chin";The latest research adopting software technology to improve pointing performance is through an Extended Automatic Pointing Assistive Program (EAPAP). However, EAPAP has some limitations. This study evaluated whether two children with developmental disabilities would be able to improve their pointing performance through an Extended Dual Cursor Automatic Pointing Assistive Program (EDCAPAP), which solves the limitations of EAPAP. Initially, both participants had their baseline sessions. Then intervention started with the first participant. New baseline and intervention occurred with the second participant when his performance was consolidated. Finally, both participants were exposed to the maintenance phase, in which their pointing performance improved significantly. Results of this study showed that, with the assistance of EDCAPAP, participants can position targets quickly, easily, and accurately, thus helping the disabled to solve their pointing problems.

Tooth-brushing intervention programme among children with mental handicap;"Stefanovska, E.; Nakova, M.; Radojkova-Nikolovska, V.; Ristoska, S.";Aim and methods: For realizing our study the supervised tooth-brushing program was carried out among 100 schoolchildren at the age of 9-12 and 13-16 years with low and moderate mental handicap in Skopje. To evaluate the results of six months intervention program, concentrated on encouragement of independent manual skills, OHI levels were detected by Green-Vermillion and CPITN index levels to characterize the gingival and periodontal health. Results: For comparative analyzes of date-base OHI levels and after six months of intervention program, we detected that the mean date-base OHI index level for mentally handicaped children are 2.46, and at the end of the program (after six months) it was 0.73. CPITN index levels at the beginning and after six months of intervention programmed for mentally handicaped children in both age groups, also confirmed r statistical significance for this examined parameter, with evident reduction of CPITN mean levels from 2.11 to 0.95. Correlation among date-base OHI levels and levels at the end of our intervention program means high positive correlation between these index levels at the beginningand final examinations. Conclusion: This program gave promising results and was effective in reducing the plaque and gingivitis scores, so the key to long-term success of the program is to maintain the subjects' motivation to make oral hygiene a part of their daily routine and thus sustain this improvement.;2010;;Bratislava Medical Journal;111;5;299-302;;;;#11189;Stefanovska 2010;
Cycling for Students with ASD: Self-Regulation Promotes Sustained Physical Activity;"Todd, Teri; Reid, Greg; Butler-Kisber, Lynn";Individuals with autism often lack motivation to engage in sustained physical activity. Three adolescents with severe autism participated in a 16-week program and each regularly completed 30 min of cycling at the end of program. This study investigated the effect of a self-regulation instructional strategy on sustained cycling, which included self-monitoring, goal setting, and self-reinforcement. Of particular interest was the development of self efficacy during the physical activity as a mediator of goal setting. A multiple baseline changing criterion design established the effectiveness of the intervention. The results suggest that self-regulation interventions can promote sustained participation in physical activity for adolescents with severe autism.

The effect of physical fitness training on reaction time in youth with intellectual disabilities;"Yildirim, Necmiye Ün; Erbahçeci, Fatih; Ergun, Nevin; Pitetti, Kenneth H.; Beets, Michael W.";The purpose of this study was to assess whether reaction time in persons with intellectual disabilities can be improved with an exercise program. 50 children and adolescents (M age = 14.7 yr., SD = 1.4, range = 11–18) with mild intellectual disability without Downs syndrome were randomly divided into control (20 boys, 5 girls) and experimental (19 boys, 6 girls) groups. The experimental group participated in a structured physical fitness program for 12 weeks. Reaction time was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Significant improvements in reaction time were observed in the exercise group but not for the control group. Results indicated that reaction time can be improved with an exercise program in youth with intellectual disability.

Enhancing multiplication performance in students with moderate intellectual disabilities using pegword mnemonics paired with a picture fading technique;Zisimopoulos, D.A.;The present study examined the effectiveness of an instructional package that included an adapted version of pegword mnemonics paired with a picture fading technique in teaching two students with moderate intellectual disabilities to recall 28 single-digit multiplication facts between 2 and 9. The instructional package was assessed using a multiple baseline design across students. Results indicated that instruction produced substantial and immediate effects in that both students increased their accuracy at recalling basic multiplication facts, maintained the newly acquired skill, and were able to generalize it across material, format, and another trainer. These results have implications for teaching students with intellectual disabilities basic math facts that are considered important for gaining access to the general curriculum. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;2010;;Journal of Behavioral Education;19;2;117-133;;10.1007/s10864-010-9104-7;;#11267;Zisimopoulos 2010;

Improving Literacy Skills in Students with Complex Communication Needs Who Use Augmentative/Alternative Communication Systems;"Bailey, Rita L.; Angell, Maureen E.; Stoner, Julia B.";A structured intervention package including direct, scaffolded, instructional lessons was implemented using an error correction learning system and a picture book-based phonological and phonemic awareness activity for four participants with complex communication needs, ranging from 12 to 15 years, in a junior high school setting. Although variability in participant results was noted, a functional relationship between the structured literacy intervention package and sound to letter matching ability was found. Results of this investigation indicate that this intervention package appears promising for facilitating learning of sound-to-letter matching skills in students with complex communication needs who use augmentative/alternative communication systems. However, due to the nature of single-subject research, generalizability of results is in question. Additionally, further research is needed to determine the effect of this intervention on word decoding and reading comprehension skills.

Can participating in games based learning improve mathematic skills in students with intellectual disabilities?;"Brown, D.J.; Ley, J.; Evett, L.; Standen, P.";This study assesses whether participating in games based learning can improve mathematical skills in students with intellectual disabilities (ID), a functional skill that promotes greater inclusion in society, health and well being. Sixteen key stage 2 to 5 students with ID participated in the study. A matched pairs design was used, with 8 students playing the intervention game teaching manipulation of fractions, and 8 students playing a battery of control games. The students played the games over five, twenty minute, weekly sessions with two baseline non-standardized measures of mathematical skills taken both before and after intervention. Participants in the intervention group significantly improved their understanding of fractions, whilst those in the control group showed no significant improvement. The majority demonstrated an increase in both the difficulty of the games played and their in-game scores, showing that participating in games based learning can improve mathematical skills in students with ID. © 2011 IEEE.;2011;;;;;;;10.1109/SeGAH.2011.6165461;;#10762;Brown 2011;

Use of picture response cards in the general education classroom to increase participation of students with mild mental disabilities;Clarke, Laura S.;The passage of IDEA and No Child Left Behind have highlighted the importance of all students having access to the general curriculum, and to learning in the least restrictive environment. Prior to IDEA and No Child Left Behind, students with intellectual disabilities were often excluded from instruction in the general education classroom, and were provided separate instruction. Research-based strategies are needed to support education of students with intellectual disabilities in the general education classroom. This study used an ABAB design to investigate the effects of using response cards to increase student participation, accuracy and test performance in the general education classroom. Results of this study suggest that response cards are an effective instructional strategy to increase in on-task behavior, accurate responding, and test scores for students with intellectual disabilities. Results from this study extend earlier research in which authors found that response cards increase the participation of students with intellectual disabilities in the resource setting.

CSCL for intellectually disabled pupils: Stimulating interaction by using a floor control mechanism;"Cress, Ulrike; Wodzicki, Katrin; Bientzle, Martina; Lingnau, Andreas";Computer-supported collaborative learning has an unexploited potential of becoming an effective learning method for pupils with intellectual disabilities. This paper aims at showing how some specific requirements of this target group may be met by structuring a learning situation with the help of floor control, which restricts the opportunities of a learning dyad to act simultaneously within the learning environment. It was expected that floor control could improve communication between pupils with intellectual disabilities by explicitly structuring and restricting activities in the learning environment and making it necessary for the pupils to communicate. To examine if floor control really supports the collaboration process in the hypothesized way, two different versions of a CSCL environment were implemented and compared. The results revealed improved task-related communication and a higher quality of interaction outcomes.

Comparison of Direct Instruction and Problem Solving Approach in Teaching Social Skills to Children with Mental Retardation.;DAĞSEVEN EMECEN, Deniz;This study was aimed at comparing the effectiveness and efficiency of direct instruction and problem solving approaches in teaching social skills to children with mental retardation. The design was adapted alternating treatment design. The subjects of the study consist of a girl and a boy between the ages of 11 and 13 who are mentally retarded. In order to collect the research data, teacher's interview form, the control check lists of social skills, criterion-referenced tests and data record sheets to use during direct instruction and problem solving approaches, efficiency form were developed and used. Visual graphical analysis method was used in the analysis of the data. The outcome shows that direct instruction approach was more effective than problem solving approach in teaching social skills to first subject. In acquisition of social skills direct instruction was more efficient in terms of total training time and training errors through criterion than problem solving approach.

Promoting Health-Related Fitness for Elementary Students with Intellectual Disabilities through a Specifically Designed Activity Program;"Davis, Kathryn; Zhang, Guili; Hodson, Patricia";"The Motivate, Adapt, and Play Program was specifically designed as an adapted physical activity (PA) program for students with intellectual disabilities (ID) to meet required school PA policies to combat childhood obesity. The policies commonly require a minimum of 30 min of PA per school day. A study was undertaken to test the efficacy of the program. Twenty-five students with ID (9 girls, 16 boys; ages 9.7 plus or minus 1.2) from four elementary schools in the southeastern United States participated in the study. The health-related fitness measures of the 16-m shuttle run test, the modified curl-up test, and the back-saver sit-and-reach test were completed at the beginning and at the end of an 8-week period. Body mass index (BMI) measurements were also obtained. During the interval, participants completed a 30 min/day, 5 days/week activity program, focusing on cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, and muscular strength and endurance activities, utilizing specialized equipment. Over the 8 weeks, there was a significant increase in the health-related fitness scores obtained. As expected, there was a slight decrease in BMI over 8 weeks, although it was a nonsignificant finding. The findings suggest that the health-related fitness of students with ID can be improved through engaging in a school-based daily adapted PA program.";2011;06-01;Journal of Policy and Practice in Intellectual Disabilities;8;2;77-84;;;;#28526;Davis 2011;
The Effectiveness of Electronic Text and Pictorial Graphic Organizers to Improve Comprehension Related to Functional Skills;"Douglas, K.H.; Ayres, K.M.; Langone, J.; Bramlett, V.B.";This study evaluated the effects of a computer-based instructional program to assist three students with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities in using pictorial graphic organizers as aids for increasing comprehension of electronic text-based recipes. Student comprehension of recipes was measured by their ability to verbally retell recipe steps with their graphic organizer. Students' ability to follow a novel recipe with the assistance of a pictorial graphic organizer tested generalization and authentic use of the recipes. A multiple-probe design across participants evaluated the functional relationship between the graphic organizer and comprehension. All students improved their comprehension related to the e-text presentation of recipes after the introduction of graphic organizers, and performance generalized to the novel recipes and actual food preparation. Results of the investigation are discussed in the context of integrating graphic organizers into the curriculum and technology-enhanced text-based activities. © 2011 Technology and Media Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.;2011;;Journal of Special Education Technology;26;1;43-56;;10.1177/016264341102600105;;#10965;Douglas 2011;
The increase of attention in Rett Syndrome: A pre-test/post-test research design;"Fabio, Rosa Angela; Giannatiempo, Samantha; Oliva, Patrizia; Murdaca, Anna Maria";Rett Syndrome (RS) is a neuro-developmental disorder, predominantly affecting females, resulting in severe mental retardation and neuro-behavioral disability. Some RS theoreticians hypothesize that behaviors that are neurologically driven are not open to modification. Despite these claims, the aim of this study is to show that girls with RS can increase high attention abilities through well structured procedures. Twelve girls with RS are involved in training based on the improvement of the attention process and reduction of help needed. The procedure was carried out in five phases with a pre-test/post-test design for clinical research. Results point out that girls with RS show an improvement in selective attention and a decrease in the amount of help needed during the training. This intervention demonstrated that individuals with RS could be promoted and motivated to learn when they were appropriately and therapeutically stimulated.

Bagged lunch preparation by adolescents with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities: Sight word instruction through peer modeling;Green, Anna Darnese;This study examined the effects of teaching students with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities to use sight words embedded in an order form to prepare bagged lunches. The intervention package consisted of decontextualized sight word instruction and bagged lunch preparation via peer modeling by other students with intellectual disabilities. A multiple probe design across word sets was employed to evaluate the effects of sight word instruction on four measures: decontextualized flashcard reading, contextualized order from reading, accurate item selection, and bagged lunch preparation task steps. The bagged lunch task analysis was used to measure the participants’ comprehension of the target words and their ability to demonstrate stimulus and response generalization. Results indicate that the intervention package was effective in teaching two of the four students to use sight words embedded in order forms to make bagged lunches. They also generalized their ability to making novel bagged lunches when the sight words were recombined on order forms. The advantages of using students with intellectual disabilities as peer-models to promote functional literacy skills are discussed, as well as intervention procedures that promote success when peer modeling is not appropriate.

Play, behaviour, language and social skills: The comparison of a play and a non-play intervention within a specialist school setting;"O'Connor, C.; Stagnitti, K.";The aim of the present study was to investigate the play, behaviour, language and social skills of children aged 5-8 years participating in a play intervention (based on the 'Learn to Play' program) compared to a group of children participating in traditional classroom activities within a specialist school over a six month period. Thirty-five children participated in the study, 19 participated in the play intervention group and 16 participated in the comparison group. Fourteen staff members at the special school were involved. A quasi-experimental design was used with pre and post data collection. Children in the play intervention and the comparison group were assessed using the Child-Initiated Pretend Play Assessment (play), Goal Attainment Scaling (behaviour), the Preschool Language Scale (language) and the Penn Interactive Peer Play Scale (social skills) at baseline and at follow up. Findings revealed that children participating in the play intervention showed a significant decrease in play deficits, became less socially disruptive and more socially connected with their peers. Both groups improved in their overall language skills and significantly improved in their goal attainment. This study supports the use of a play intervention in improving a child's play, behaviour, language and social skills. © 2011.;2011;;Research in Developmental Disabilities;32;3;1205-1211;;10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.037;;#10948;O'Connor 2011;
Comparison of simultaneous prompting with continuous probe sessions and intermittent probe sessions [Ögrencilerin Öǧrenmesi ve Sinif Etkileşimini geliştirmek üzere Soru Cevap Sistemlerini Kullanimi];"Özkan, Ş.Y.; Gürsel, O.";Problem Statement: One of the effective instructional procedures for students with intellectual disabilities is simultaneous prompting (SP). In SP, there is high percentage of daily probe errors that occur and students are not able to respond independently during the training sessions, so probe trials are necessary to assess the transfer of stimulus control however, these probe trials require additional time. In order to decrease the error rate and the amount of the training time, probe trials may be carried out prior to every third or fourth training session rather than every session. Purpose of Study: The purpose of the study was to compare the use of SP with the continuous probe sessions and SP with the intermittent probe sessions in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization. In addition, the acquisition of instructive feedback was examined. Method: Three male students aged from 15 to 17 with intellectual disabilities participated in this study. All students attended the eighth grade of a public special education school for students with intellectual disabilities. An adapted alternating treatments design was used and replicated across the three subjects. The dependent variable of study was the percentage of correct responses and the independent variables of study were the SP with the continuous probe sessions and SP with the intermittent probe sessions. The reliability data were collected for both the dependent and independent variables. Reliability data were collected for each student and each condition in at least 20% of all sessions. Finding and Results: The results of the study showed that (a) SP with the continuous probe and SP with the intermittent probe were effective in teaching the product warning labels to students with intellectual disabilities, (b) SP with the intermittent probe was more effective than the SP with the continuous probe, (c) there was no significant difference in generalization of SP with the continuous probe and SP with the intermittent probe, and (d) the three students acquired the instructive feedback about the definition of product warning labels. Conclusions and Recommendations: In the study, the amount of training time and the number of errors were decreased when the SP with the intermittent probe was used. In this case, since there was less training time required and the error levels were low, the SP with the intermittent probe could be the preferable and more efficient application when compared with the SP with the continuous probe.;2011;;Egitim Arastirmalari - Eurasian Journal of Educational Research;;45;69-88;;;;#10756;Özkan 2011;
Effects of Language of Implementation on Functional Analysis Outcomes.;"Rispoli, Mandy; O'Reilly, Mark; Lang, Russell; Sigafoos, Jeff; Mulloy, Austin; Aguilar, Jeannie; Singer, George";"This study evaluated the influence of language of implementation on functional analysis outcomes for a child with a severe intellectual disability from a Spanish-speaking home. Challenging behavior was assessed during 5-min sessions under 4 conditions; attention, play-verbal, play-nonverbal, and demand and across 2 phases; implementation in English versus Spanish. The highest levels of challenging behavior occurred during the attention and demand conditions of the English phases. These results suggest that the language of implementation may influence the overall levels of challenging behavior within functional analysis conditions.

A Comparison of Spanish and English Multimedia Shared Story Interventions on the Acquisition of English Vocabulary Words for English Language Learners with an Intellectual Disability;Rivera, Christopher Juan;"Literature on the development of literacy skills for students with a moderate to severe intellectual disability is growing; however, little is known about effective literacy practices for Hispanic English language learners with a moderate intellectual disability. Additionally, little research has been conducted on how to utilize a student's primary language, technologies found in the classroom, and systematic instruction to teach English oral vocabulary to this specific population. The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative effects of an English and Spanish multimedia shared story intervention, with a constant time delay procedure, on the acquisition of English oral vocabulary for two English language learners with a moderate intellectual disability. Instruction was provided to students for two weeks and lasted approximately 7-11 minutes per session. Results from the study suggest that language of instruction played an important role in English vocabulary acquisition. Second, results also indicated that language of instruction did not have a meaningful impact on generalization and maintenance of vocabulary from both conditions over time. Finally, teachers reported that multimedia shared stories were practical and a useful supplemental form of instruction.

Effects of varying lengths of synthetic speech output on augmented requesting and natural speech production in an adolescent with klinefelter syndrome;"Sigafoos, J.; Wermink, H.; Didden, R.; Green, V.A.; Schlosser, R.W.; O'Reilly, M.F.; Lancioni, G.E.";Students with developmental disabilities and limited or no functional speech often use speech-generating devices. While the speech-output function of such devices is considered to have potential advantages, it is unclear whether the length of synthetic speech output influences augmented communication and natural speech production. To this end, we describe a two-phase study involving an adolescent with Klinefelter syndrome. In Phase 1, the frequency of augmented requests and natural speech were compared under three speech-output conditions (no-output, short-output, and long-output). In Phase 2, augmented requests in the long-output condition were no longer reinforced to determine if this would increase natural speech production. The presence and length of speech output did not influence the frequency of augmented requesting or natural speech production in Phase 1, but extinction of augmented requesting under the long-output condition in Phase 2 was associated with a significant increase in natural speech production under that condition, relative to the two other conditions. The implications of these findings for using speech-generating devices are discussed. © 2011 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.;2011;;AAC: Augmentative and Alternative Communication;27;3;163-171;;10.3109/07434618.2011.610355;;#10857;Sigafoos 2011;

Increasing literacy skills for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities: Effects of integrating comprehensive reading instruction with sign language;"Beecher, Larissa; Childre, Amy";This study evaluated the impact of a comprehensive reading program enhanced with sign language on the literacy and language skills of three elementary school students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Students received individual and small group comprehensive reading instruction for approximately 55 minutes per session. Reading instruction combined the PCI Reading Program with literacy and language activities to target concepts of print, phonemic and phonological awareness, sight word recognition, vocabulary and oral language, and comprehension. Results indicated that all three participants showed growth in their literacy skills, specifically in the areas of letter identification, letter-sound knowledge, sight word knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and listening comprehension. Implications for future research and educational practices for utilizing comprehensive reading instruction are discussed.

Effects of a social skill instruction program on the social skill acquisition of African American high school students with mild intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors;Brophy, Alicia Amanda;Disproportionality and the poor post-school outcomes for African American youth with disabilities have been ongoing issues in special education. Limited opportunities to engage in social interactions may exacerbate these poor post-school outcomes for African American students with mild intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors. African American students per population consistently receive more office referrals, out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions than other students. Effective interventions that can offset social skill deficits or aggressive behaviors of African American students are important. One way to increase the social competence of African American youth with aggression who frequently display social skill deficits may be social skill instruction with anger management. By increasing students' social competence it may facilitate students' success within the school environment and enhance their post-school outcomes. A difficulty researchers have experienced is in getting social behaviors taught to generalize to more than one place and maintain over time. A way to facilitate the generalization of social skills may be to employ multiple exemplar training (i.e., training across different settings, varied role-play scenarios, training by different people). Research supports the idea that parent collaboration may help facilitate students' learning of social skills and increase the likelihood of generalization of these skills from the instructional small group to the classroom setting. Furthermore, when parents are informed that social skills are being taught at schools, they are more likely to prompt their child to practice these skills and reinforce skill demonstration in the home environment. Culturally relevant social skill instruction is rare in the literature, despite the inherent need for this type of instruction for African American learners. A culturally responsive, social skill instruction program can serve as a way to promote the overall social competence of this population of students. This study examined the effects of a small group, culturally responsive social skill instruction program, incorporating parental involvement, on increasing the prosocial behaviors of three African American high school students with mild intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviors. In addition, the function of participants' social behavior was examined and incorporated into instruction.

Using computer-assisted method to teach children with intellectual disabilities handwashing skills;"Choi, K.-S.; Wong, P.-K.; Chung, W.-Y.";Purpose: To motivate children with intellectual disabilities (ID) to learn handwashing and improve their performance by using computer-assisted teaching method. Method: A teaching program was implemented using a computerized teaching station with faucet, soap dispenser and towel dispenser as user interface. In response to the children's actions, animations were shown on the computer screen of the teaching station. A controlled study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed method (study group) with that of the convention teaching method (control group). Both groups of subjects attended a 30-min handwashing lesson twice per week for 2 months. Their performance was evaluated using a handwashing task checklist and a learning motivation questionnaire, and by measuring the completion time and assessing their hand cleanliness. Results: The computer-assisted teaching program improved the handwashing performance and learning motivation of the subjects. The study group appeared to outperform the control group. Observations reflected that the subjects were highly motivated to learn handwashing with the computerized teaching station. Conclusion: The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the teaching and learning of handwashing skills for children with ID. Implications for Rehabilitation Children with intellectual disabilities are prone to contracting infectious diseases. Proper handwashing can reduce the risk of infection. Handwashing skills are taught in special schools but outbreaks continue to occur. Computer-assisted teaching method has potential to improve the children's learning motivation and handwashing performance. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.;2012;;Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology;7;6;507-516;;10.3109/17483107.2011.652998;;#10415;Choi 2012;
Promoting peer interactions of students with severe disabilities who use speech-generating devices in general education classrooms;Chung, Yun-Ching;Although the importance and benefits of peer interaction have been well-documented in the literature, students with severe disabilities are often socially isolated in inclusive classrooms. In particular, barriers to peer interactions (e.g., inconsistent access to their communication devices, inadequate skills to interact with peers, or lack of knowledge and skills of their partners and facilitators) may be more evident for students who use augmentative and alternative communication. This study addressed two questions: (a) What were the effects of the intervention package incorporating peer training, paraprofessional training, and the use of devices for students with severe disabilities who used speech-generating devices (SGDs) in inclusive classrooms? (b) To what extent was the intervention considered socially valid by key stakeholders? Two students with intellectual disabilities and their parents, peers without disabilities, paraprofessionals, and classroom teachers participated in this study. Peers without disabilities and paraprofessionals learned to identify communication opportunities for classroom interactions and how to interact with the focus students using SGDs. In addition, parents of focus students suggested conversation topics and/or programmed SGD messages for peer interactions. A multiple baseline design across students and classrooms was used to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. We used direct observations and interviews to collect information on the target outcomes and the social importance of the study. The peer interactions of focus students increased in three out of four classrooms and SGD use increased in all four classrooms. However, substantial variations in both outcomes were found within and across classrooms following the intervention. Findings from pre- and post-intervention interviews suggested participating students, peers, educators, and parents perceived the intervention goals, procedures, and outcomes as important, appropriate, and beneficial. Implications and recommendation are provided for educators and future researchers who want to improve the social participation of students with severe disabilities who use SGDs in inclusive classrooms.

A Comparison of Two Cognitive Reading Strategies on the Comprehension of Functional Expository Text by High School Students with Mild Intellectual Disabilities;Feeney, Susan L.;"This dissertation report focuses on the results of an intervention study that examined the effectiveness of two cognitive-based reading strategies (""5 Ws and an H"" and paragraph summarization) on the reading comprehension skills of 13 high school students with mild intellectual disabilities as well as the students' abilities to generalize these skills to various functional expository reading passages. There were four experimental phases in the study: Baseline, Intervention, Maintenance 1, and Maintenance 2. During each phase, participants were required to read functional expository texts and answer researcher-developed reading comprehension probes. Baseline conditions were continued throughout the study to measure the ability of students to generalize reading comprehension skills. During the Intervention Phase, students were provided instruction on the two cognitive-based reading strategies within a single-subject alternating treatments research design. During the Maintenance 1 Phase, students were asked to choose between the strategies that were taught during Intervention. Qualitative data were also collected pre- and postintervention regarding students' perceptions of their reading abilities, as well as postintervention perceptions on the helpfulness of the strategies. Both individual and group data were analyzed using percentage of non-overlapping data points (PND) during the Intervention Phase and mean scores of reading comprehension probes during all phases of the study. Mean scores on the pre- and postintervention questionnaires were also analyzed. Findings suggested that participants improved their scores on the reading comprehension probes during the Intervention Phase with paragraph summarization being the more effective of the two strategies. Findings also revealed that, when given a choice, participants did not always choose to use the reading strategy that the Intervention data suggested was more effective for them. Regardless, students did perceive improvement in their overall reading abilities pre- to postintervention and did believe the strategies were helpful to improving their reading comprehension skills. These findings are consistent with existing literature on individuals with mild intellectual disabilities which suggest this population can improve reading comprehension skills. These findings contribute to the dearth of literature that actually focuses on reading comprehension skills specific to high school-aged individuals with mild intellectual disabilities. Limitations of the study were reviewed and recommendations for further research were discussed. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Two Approaches to Phonics Instruction: Comparison of Effects with Children with Significant Cognitive Disability;Finnegan, Elizabeth Grace;;2012;;EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES;47;3;269-279;;;;#2302;Finnegan 2012;
Comparison of the effects of two systematic approaches of phonics instruction on the ability of children with significant cognitive disabilities to read words;Finnegan, Elizabeth Grace;"This study compared the effect of two systematic methods of phonics instruction for children with significant cognitive disabilities. Paucity in the literature on phonics instruction for children with cognitive disabilities, combined with legislative demands for evidence-based practice, stress the need for studies to test the effectiveness of instructional methods for all members of the school-aged student population. Fifty-two participants (mean IQ = 55.96), aged 5–12 years were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups; (1) a synthetic phonics instruction group, in which participants received 12 sessions of instruction, in which they were taught how to blend individual sound-letter correspondences to read words, (2) an analogy phonics instruction group, in which participants received 12 sessions of instruction, in which they were taught to learn segments of words known as ""rimes"" that follow consistent visual and auditory patterns to read words and (3) a control group. Analysis of covariance showed no significant effect between groups on post test scores of Letter-Word Identification Test and Word Attack Test on the Woodcock-Johnson III Diagnostic Reading Battery (WJIIIDRB, Shrank, Mather & Woodcock, 2004). Significant effects were found on measures created by the researcher for training word identification F(2,48) = 16.353, p<.01 and for transfer word identification F(2,48) = 4.293, p<.05, after controlling for pretest scores. In post hoc analysis paired t-tests showed a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores on the Letter-Word Identification Test (Shrank et al., 2004). Analysis of the variance showed significant differences between the nine participants who did not learn any training or transfer words in the course of the study and other participants on the pretests for Letter-Word Identification Test and Word Attack Test (Shrank at al., 2004). Findings suggest that for many students with significant cognitive disabilities phonics instruction, especially synthetic phonics instruction is beneficial. The design of the instructional materials and one-to-one instruction may have been contributing factors to the effectiveness of both approaches. Further research should focus on the maintenance and generalization of phonics skills acquired by children with significant cognitive disabilities.

Effects of direct instruction on the use of and response to prepositions by students with an intellectual disability;Hicks, S. Christy;"Students with an intellectual disability often struggle with significant language delays or impairments. Although this population of students can acquire language skills, they often require methods of explicit instruction of language skills to do so. Direct Instruction (DI), a system of explicit and systematic instruction, could be one of these methods. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of DI on the use of and response to prepositions by three elementary school students with an intellectual disability. A multiple baseline design across prepositions was used in this study with replication across students. The researcher used DI to model examples and nonexamples (i.e., ""This is above,"" ""This is not above."") of three prepositions (e.g., above, behind, beneath) to the students. In addition to the instructional sessions, students participated in three generalization activities. Results of this study showed a functional relationship between Direct Instruction and students' use of and response to prepositions. Students demonstrated the ability to use and respond to prepositions consistently after receiving DI on each of the three target prepositions. Furthermore, all three students maintained the skill up to 56 days from instruction on each of the prepositions. These findings are important to this population of students because of the need for explicit and systematic instruction of language skills; it has been demonstrated that DI is an effective instructional tool in teaching these skills in an efficient and effective way.

Effects of neurofeedback training on attention in children with intellectual disability;"Hong, Changhee; Lee, Inkyoung";This study investigated effects of neurofeedback (NFB) training on attention in children with intellectual disability (ID). Twenty-one children with ID were assigned to an NFB training group (n = 7), to a visual perception (VP) training group (n = 7), or to a no-treatment group (n = 7). Two groups received 36 sessions of NFB or VP training, respectively, over 12 weeks. Children’s Color Trails Test–2, Stroop Color and Word Test, and Digit Span were administered to all participants before and after training. The follow-up study was conducted with both the NFB and VP groups in the same way after 3 months. The EEGs of the NFB group also were measured. The NFB group showed significantly improved scores on the all tests compared to the 2 control groups. The brainwaves of the frontal lobes of the NFB group declined significantly in theta wave amplitude and theta-to-beta ratio. The NFB results were maintained in the follow-up study. Beta/SMR uptraining seemed to be an effective way to enhance attention in children with ID.

The Induction of Emergent Relations in Children with Severe Cognitive and Language Delays;Howarth, Matthew;In three experiments I sought to experimentally test a source of emergent relations defined as transitivity by Stimulus Equivalence theory or as combinatorial entailment in Relational Frame Theory. In Experiment I, the participants were 4 children diagnosed with autism who also demonstrated significant cognitive and language delays, who were selected for the experiment because of their inability to demonstrate emergent/derived relations during baseline. A time-lagged multiple probe design was utilized to determine the effects of training of a frame of symmetry through the use of a cross modal matching procedure requiring the participants to match auditory stimuli to visual stimuli and conversely visual stimuli to auditory stimuli using a computer program. The dependent variables were the participant's responses to the emergent relations of transitivity/combinatorial entailment, post intervention, with a probe set and a novel set of stimuli, as well as the participant's rate of learning for tacts and textual responses. Three of four participants were able to demonstrate emergent relations following intervention. The participant who did not demonstrate derived relations lacked an echoic repertoire. In Experiment II, I built on the findings of Experiment I to determine if derived relations could be taught visually, without the use of language. Three males with severe language disorders, who did not display emergent relations during baseline, participated in the experiment. A time-lagged multiple probe design, with counterbalanced probes was used to determine the effects of multiple exemplar training across visual relations. The dependent variable was the participant's responses to emergent relation probes following intervention. None of the participants were able to demonstrate derived relations after visual symmetry training. In the third experiment, the same participants and materials were used as Experiment II, however, in Experiment III, a tact was taught for each of the stimulus sets in order to determine the role of the tact in emergent relations. A time lagged multiple probe design, with counterbalanced probes was used. The dependent variable was again participant's responses to emergent relation probes following tact training. All 3 participants were able to demonstrate derived relations with the probe and novel set of stimuli following intervention. Results of all three experiments suggest that both bi-directional/symmetrical relations and verbal operants are necessary for derived relations.

Effects of a Peer-Delivered System of Least Prompts Intervention Package and Academic Read-Alouds on Listening Comprehension for Students with Moderate Intellectual Disability;Hudson, Melissa Ellen;"Comprehension of text is a strong focus of instruction in general education. Likewise, comprehension of text should be a strong focus of instruction for students with moderate intellectual disability even though they may not be independent readers. Shared story reading is a practice used to access grade-level literature for non-readers. This study used a multiple probe single case design to evaluate the effects of a peer-delivered system of least prompts intervention package and grade-level adapted academic read-alouds on listening comprehension for three participants with moderate intellectual disability. Fifth grade peer tutors delivered the intervention during second literacy block. The intervention included read-alouds of an adapted version of ""The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963"" (Curtis, 1995), a novel currently read by fifth graders without disabilities in the district. The system of least prompts intervention package included rules for answering wh- word questions, opportunities to hear selected text again, and self-monitoring. Participants with disabilities directed the amount of help they received from peer tutors. Results indicated that (a) all participants improved the number of correct listening comprehension responses after text only prompts, (b) the effect of the intervention package on independent unprompted correct listening comprehension responses was mixed, and (c) stakeholders rated the study's procedures, outcomes, and goals as important.

Using an iTouch to Teach Core Curriculum Words and Definitions: Efficacy and Social Validity;"Jameson, J.M.; Thompson, V.; Manuele, G.; Smith, D.; Egan, H.; Moore, T.";Media scholars have long recognized the interaction between the medium that conveys the information and the information that is conveyed. This study examined the relative impact of different low- and high-tech instructional mediums (e.g., flashcards and the iTouch) on the acquisition of general education content-referenced sight words and definitions by students with significant cognitive disabilities. Results indicated that most of the students (three of the four students in the study) preferred high-tech instructional mediums during preference assessments prior to instruction.

Promoting Listening Reading Comprehension for Nonverbal English Language Learners Who Have a Severe Intellectual Delay;Kemper, Talya;This study used an alternating treatment design to examine the use of a listening reading comprehension intervention package. This package was implemented in English as well as bilingually (on alternating days). This package was applied to four participants who were English Language Learners, were diagnosed with a severe intellectual delay, and were nonverbal. No studies to date have applied a listening reading comprehension program to participants with such unique challenges. All participants demonstrated an increase in both their total number of responses to comprehension questions and in their communication attempts. Participants demonstrated increases in both the English-only intervention and the bilingual intervention, however, when the bilingual intervention was implemented, a slightly larger increase in initiating communication and answering questions was seen. Future research should continue to explore what language instruction should be provided in for students with severe intellectual delays who are ELL and nonverbal.

A study on the impact of e-sports participation by students with mental retardation on their self-confidence and social skills;"Kim, Y.-J.; Choi, M.J.; Cha, Y.S.";The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of e-sports participation on self-confidence and social development of mentally retarded students. To collect the data, retarded male students between and old were tested. They attend a special-education school located in Ha- am, young- i and they too part in the test for times. The test is about the e-sports(FIF) and during wee s, from January th to February th, the five students too it for hours. before the five students participated in the e-sports, they had the self-confidence and social development tests and wees later they had the same tests again. according to the results of this participation, statistically, there was no effect of e-sports participation for mentally retarded students in their self-confidence and social development. However, here are some drawbacs first, there were only participants and among them only were capable to complete the questionnaire. second, seven wees were not over analysed this case. y the way, the observation results of their behavioral changes are lie the followings with the personal characteristics, the results of the questionnaire, and the period of the participation First of all, according to the personal characteristics of each retarded student, their preferences in the e-sports were different respectively. Thus, due to these dissimilar preferences, there was a difference in their results of confidence measurement. second, there was no correlation between e-sports participation and social development. based on the content and the interview of a specially trained teacher, reported that the participation of e-sports had a positive effect on the social development of mentally retarded students. n the contrary, based on the results of this case, participating e-sports itself had no effect on social development, However, the meeting during the e-sports lie an interaction to cooperated in games, or an competitive experience in on-line has an influence on social development. © 2012 IEEE.;2012;;;;;471-475;;10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261752;;#10446;Kim 2012;
Social Story(tm) interventions: An examination of effectiveness in addressing transition difficulties of students with autism spectrum disorders;Kokina, Anastasia;Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may engage in high levels of disruption and off-task behaviors when faced with school transitions and changes in daily routines. These difficulties are often viewed by parents as some of the most challenging behaviors to address in their children on a daily basis (South, Ozonoff, & McMahon, 2005). One intervention that has been proposed to address transition difficulties of individuals with ASD is Social Stories. However, their effectiveness in situations involving daily school transitions remains largely unexplored, with only a limited number of studies conducted to date. Using a withdrawal (i.e., ABAB) design, this study examined the efficacy of Social Stories in addressing transition difficulties of three students with ASD and moderate intellectual disability (ID). Results suggest mixed effectiveness of Social Stories, with promising results obtained for one out of three participants. Out of the four dependent variables targeted, the intervention held promise for addressing disruptive behaviors. The effects of the intervention were minimal for on-task behaviors, and absent for latency to transition and duration of time in transition. The intervention was viewed as acceptable by teachers and by students, and was implemented with high fidelity.

A comparative study: Completion of fine motor office related tasks by high school students with autism using video models on large and small screen sizes;"Mechling, Linda C.; Ayres, Kevin M.";The purpose of this investigation was to compare fine motor task completion when using video models presented on a smaller screen size (Personal Digital Assistant) compared to a larger laptop screen size. The investigation included four high school students with autism spectrum disorders and mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and used an adapted alternating treatments design with baseline, extended baseline, comparison, and final treatment conditions. Results showed that although independent completion of fine motor office related tasks increased under both procedures, use of video models on the larger screen resulted in a higher percentage of correct responses across all four students.

Comparative Effects of Spanish and English Vocabulary Instruction for English Language Learners with Moderate Intellectual Disability;"Rivera, Christopher J.; Wood, Charles L.; Spooner, Fred";Schools across the country are inadequately prepared to meet the educational needs of English language learners (ELLs), much less the needs of ELLs who also have an intellectual disability (ID). In this exploratory study, three Mexican American elementary students with moderate ID were given vocabulary word instruction in English and Spanish using an alternating treatments design, and the effects of the number of words correctly identified per instructional strategy were measured. Two of the students acquired a greater number of English vocabulary words in the Spanish model-lead test intervention. Vocabulary scores increased for the third student under both conditions, but there was no differential advantage by language. Implications for future research and practice related to instructional strategies for this population are discussed.

Increasing comprehension for middle school students with moderate intellectual disability on age-appropriate texts;Shurr, J.;"Students with moderate intellectual disability experience a lack of comparable access to literature as compared to their nondisabled peers (Browder et al, 2009; Kliewer, 1998). Problems in access for many of these students may be attributed to low expectations and inadequate support on behalf of students as well as a lack of sufficient literacy skills instruction. Given these issues, the literature students are able to access often is not representative of their chronological age. Literacy interventions such as read-alouds have been successfully used in special and general education alike to provide students access to literature beyond their present skill level. Using a multipleprobe design, investigators read typical age-appropriate texts and examined the effectiveness of pairing texts with the picture symbols and discussion in improving student comprehension.

Literacy Access: An Examination of the Picture Plus Discussion (PPD) Intervention Using Typical and Age Appropriate Texts;Shurr, Jordan C.;The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of the picture plus discussion (PPD) intervention on the comprehension abilities of high school students with moderate intellectual disability when read a variety of expository texts aloud. A multiple probe single subject design was employed to measure the effect of the intervention across three different texts including leveled SRA readers, stories from a local newspaper, and sections from employee handbooks. Results indicate that the PPD intervention was successful in increasing comprehension as measured by the students' story retell abilities. Comprehension assessment was collected in both three option knowledge based multiple-choice questions and student retell of the text content. While mixed results were observed in the multiple-choice accuracy, this study revealed that the PPD intervention was effective in increasing student comprehension by improving the story retell in terms of quantity (i.e. word count and idea units) and quality (i.e. text and picture relevant idea units) across the text types. These overall positive effects were replicated in the generalization phase, which involved peer supports in an inclusive, neutral school setting.

Using Embedded Computer-Assisted Instruction to Teach Science to Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders;Smith, Bethany;The need for promoting scientific literacy for all students has been the focus of recent education reform resulting in the rise of the Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics movement. For students with Autism Spectrum Disorders and intellectual disability, this need for scientific literacy is further complicated by the need for individualized instruction that is often required to teach new skills, especially when those skills are academic in nature. In order to address this need for specialized instruction, as well as scientific literacy, this study investigated the effects of embedded computer-assisted instruction to teach science terms and application of those terms to three middle school students with autism and intellectual disability. This study was implemented within an inclusive science classroom setting. A multiple probe across participants research design was used to examine the effectiveness of the intervention. Results of this study showed a functional relationship between the number of correct responses made during probe sessions and introduction of the intervention. Additionally, all three participants maintained the acquired science terms and applications over time and generalized these skills across materials and settings. The findings of this study suggest several implications for practice within inclusive settings and provide suggestions for future research investigating the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction to teach academic skills to students with Autism Spectrum Disorders and intellectual disability.

The impact of computer-assisted sight word instruction on the reading skills of students with significant intellectual disabilities;Wood-Fields, Colleen Frances;There is a paucity of research identifying instructional methods that promote the reading development of students with significant intellectual disabilities (ID). This research study employed a single subject, multiple baseline design to evaluate the effects of computer-assisted sight word instruction employing constant time delay (CTD) procedures with incidental phonics and comprehension stimuli on the reading skill development of six elementary students with moderate ID and expressive language impairments. Study results suggest that the seven week PowerPoint slide show sight word intervention had very small to moderate intervention effects on receptive sight word identification. However, students learned some incidental letter-sound correspondences and demonstrated gains in sight word comprehension. Study results suggest that the computer-assisted sight word intervention may provide a means to foster the development of foundational reading skills with students with moderate ID. Future research is needed to determine if students generalize the essential reading skills acquired through the computer-assisted intervention to the reading material they encounter in home, school, and community environments.

Evaluating a Computer-Based Sight-Word Reading Intervention in a Student With Intellectual Disabilities;"Yaw, J.; Skinner, C.H.; Orsega, M.C.; Parkhurst, J.; Booher, J.; Chambers, K.";The authors used a multiple-baseline-across-behaviors (i.e., word lists) design to evaluate a computer-based flashcard intervention on automatic sight-word reading in a 4th-grade student with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities. Immediately after the intervention was applied to each of three lists of sight words, the student made rapid gains in her ability to read those words within 2 s. Approximately 8 weeks after the final intervention session, evidence for maintenance and generalization were collected when the student read words learned during the computer-based flashcard procedure that were hand written on index cards, as opposed to displayed on the computer screen. The authors' discussion focuses on the contextual validity (e.g., sustainability, efficiency) of this computer-based intervention. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;2012;;Journal of Applied School Psychology;28;4;354-366;;10.1080/15377903.2012.722181;;#10427;Yaw 2012;

An intervention program related to reading development - A case study of a child with williams syndrome;"Anastasia, A.; Griva, E.; Massi, M.";The present paper is related to a case study of an 8-year-old girl with Williams syndrome and mild intellectual disability. Initial informal assessments and standardized tests indicated that her reading ability was underdeveloped, as well as her phonological awareness. Hence, an intervention for the development of reading skills was designed according to the principles of the 'top-down'educational model, combining features from several teaching methods, suchas 'holistic approach', 'holistic-analytical method', and 'whole-word teaching'. The student's progress was recorded in the researcher's journal and evaluated through informal continuous assessment and standardized test. She managed to read 45 out of 65 words, which were included in the intervention, simple syllables with the consonant-vowel sequence and some simple two-syllable words without any complex content, not included in the intervention. The intervention proved to be effective, as the student indicated development in her reading skills, although to a certain degree. Finally, the results verified the influence of the phonological factor in reading and highlighted the holist approach as an appropriate way to develop reading and comprehension skills.;2013;;Hrvatska Revija Za Rehabilitacijska Istrazivanja;49;SUPPL.;154-163;;;;#10278;Anastasia 2013;
Effectiveness of video modelling in training students with intellectual disabilities to greet people when they meet [Zihinsel Yetersizliǧi Olan Ögrencilere Selam Verme Becerisinin Öǧretiminde Videoyla Model Olmanin Etkililiǧi];Avcioǧlu, H.;"This practice aims to teach students who have intellectual disabilities how to greet people when they meet them.

Teacher-conducted trial-based functional analyses as the basis for intervention;"Bloom, Sarah E.; Lambert, Joseph M.; Dayton, Elizabeth; Samaha, Andrew L.";Previous studies have focused on whether a trial-based functional analysis (FA) yields the same outcomes as more traditional FAs, and whether interventions based on trial-based FAs can reduce socially maintained problem behavior. We included a full range of behavior functions and taught 3 teachers to conduct a trial-based FA with 3 boys with developmental and intellectual disabilities who engaged in problem behavior. Based on the results of the trial-based FAs, we developed and conducted 5 function-based interventions, using differential reinforcement of an alternative behavior and extinction in all but 1 case. In the remaining case, we used noncontingent reinforcement. All interventions led to reductions in problem behavior and increases in alternative behavior.

Self-Monitoring of On-Task Behaviors Using the MotivAider® by a Middle School Student with a Moderate Intellectual Disability;"Boswell, M. Alison; Knight, Victoria; Spriggs, Amy D.";This investigation used an ABAB withdrawal design to determine the effect of self-monitoring using the MotivAider® (MotivAider, 2000) on percentage of intervals of on-task behavior by an 11-year old male with a moderate intellectual disability who attended a rural middle school. The MotivAider® is a small device, the size of a pager, which can be programmed to vibrate on a variable or fixed interval schedule. The student used the MotivAider® as a tactile prompt to self-record the presence or absence of on-task behavior at 3-min time intervals while completing math assignments independently in a resource setting. During 15-min sessions, the student completed a math assignment requiring computation skills for one- and two-digit addition and subtraction facts. The investigators used a pretest-posttest measure to examine the effects of the self-monitoring intervention on the student's math fluency before and after intervention. To enhance social validity, the instructional assistant implemented the intervention and the design of the investigation supported and monitored the student's Individualized Education Program goals for math computation and self-sufficiency. Results of this investigation demonstrated (a) an increased percentage of time on-task during self-monitoring intervention, (b) the ability of the student to accurately self-monitor his on-task behavior, and (c) a 100% increase in math fluency from the pretest to posttest.

Using Audio Recorders to Promote Independence in Grocery Shopping for Students with Intellectual Disability;"Bouck, E.C.; Satsangi, R.; Muhl, A.; Bartlett, W.";Self-prompting devices assist students with disabilities with acquiring skills and/or independence. However, limited research exists on audio recorders for nonreaders (Mechling, 2007). In this study, researchers sought to understand if use of audio recorders impacted three students' identification and selection of grocery items as compared to using a written list, which represented the traditional mode of grocery shopping students experienced during weekly outings to the grocery store for their life skills class. The results of the study indicate use of the audio recorders resulted in the three students becoming more successful at identifying grocery list items, as well as requiring fewer prompts to identify grocery items on the list correctly. In addition, the intervention of audio recorders consisted of two conditions: self-record and researcher record. The results showed the students were more successful in identifying and selecting grocery items when they recorded the list prior to entering the store as opposed to when they received the researcher prerecorded list upon arrival at the store. © 2013 Technology and Media Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.;2013;;Journal of Special Education Technology;28;4;15-26;;10.1177/016264341302800402;;#9880;Bouck 2013;

Using Story-Based Lessons to Increase Academic Engaged Time in General Education Classes for Students with Moderate Intellectual Disability and Autism;"Courtade, Ginevra R.; Lingo, Amy S.; Whitney, Todd";The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of special education and general education teachers working together to develop and implement story-based lessons on the academic engaged time of students with moderate intellectual disability and autism. A multiple probe across participants' design was used to measure teacher implementation of steps of task analyses as well as student academic engaged time. Results of this study indicate special education teachers can follow a 12-step task analysis to adapt books for students with moderate intellectual disability and autism and that general education teachers can reliably implement a task analysis that incorporates an adapted book in their reading instruction for students with moderate intellectual disability and autism. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that may offer an effective way to increase engagement for students with moderate intellectual disability and autism in general education classrooms during literacy instruction.;2013;12-01;Rural Special Education Quarterly;32;4;3-14;;;;#27605;Courtade 2013;

From initial phonics: Teaching word-analysis skills to students with moderate intellectual disability;"Fredrick, Laura D.; Davis, Dawn H.; Alberto, Paul A.; Waugh, Rebecca E.";"Reading instruction for students with MoID is typically limited to sight-word instruction. We developed a 2-part, phonetic instructional sequence based upon Direct Instruction teaching methodology to teach students with MoID word-analysis skills that generalize to untaught words encountered in their environment. Elementary and middle-school students with MoID learned word-analysis skills using simultaneous prompting procedures to explicitly teach verbal imitation of sounds, letter-sound correspondences, retrieval of learned letter-sounds to a predetermined rate of automaticity, and blending with telescoping. After demonstrating mastery of the word-analysis skills the students generalized taught blending skills to untaught CVC words; functional, community words; and environmental, connected-text phrases. A changing-criterion design embedded within a multiple baseline across sound and word sets was implemented for 3 elementary and 2 middle-school students diagnosed with MoID. Students reached mastery criterion for each phase of Initial Phonics and Functional Phonics, and a functional relation was demonstrated between the instructional sequence and students' acquisition of word-analysis skills.

Applying the concrete-semiconcrete-abstract instructional sequence in model-based teaching to facilitate the learning of area and volume by students with mild intellectual disability;Hord, Timothy Casey;In the current educational climate of IDEA 2004 and No Child Left Behind, teachers are required to find methods to give all students, including students with mild intellectual disability, access to the general education curriculum. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of instruction integrating the concrete-semiconcrete-abstract teaching sequence into model-based problem solving to teach area and volume to sixth grade students with mild intellectual disability. This study employed a multiple baseline design to establish the functional relationship between the intervention and students' performance on area and volume problems. The participants improved at solving area and volume problems and showed some success in making generalizations about area and volume concepts.

The effect of using music as a socio-affective strategy to teach English to a second grade Down syndrome student;Olmeda Casanova, Roberto;"The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of the use of music in a Down syndrome student oral comprehension as well as on his grade improvement in the English class. The research questions were aimed to answer the following queries: What is the effect of using music as an affective strategy on the English vocabulary acquisition of an eight year old second grade Down syndrome student? Does the use of music as a teaching strategy lead the student to improve his grades in the English class? The participant was an eight year old Down syndrome student who attended the second grade. He received treatment 90 minutes per week over a period of six weeks. The research instrument used was a test. A case study research was performed using a pretest-posttest applied to the same participant. A comparison between the participant's statistical answer before and after using the affective strategy was done. Furthermore, a comparison with the amount of vocabulary acquisition that took place before and after the intervention was analyzed. Findings suggest that the use of songs will probably be an effective instructional strategy to teach English vocabulary to challenged elementary school populations, especially students with Down syndrome. According to data results three conclusions can be reached. First, the participant had significantly lower averages on the pretest; second, after treatment was given, he scored higher on the posttest, and third, the gain in score could apparently be attributed to the incorporation of music as a teaching strategy during the time the treatment was given. Based on the findings of the investigation, the use of songs as an affective strategy to help Down syndrome students acquire English vocabulary is recommended as a strategy that will probably facilitate vocabulary acquisition. It is suggested to teachers that work with cognitively challenged students, to incorporate the use of songs as a teaching strategy to facilitate English vocabulary acquisition. The use of songs is apparently one method for providing a positive atmosphere conducive to language learning when dealing with mentally challenged learners.

Their academic achievement in social-economic skill course were assessed by teacher-made and performance tests. Subjects were assigned in control and experimental groups randomly and equally. Experimental group participated in 8 sessions and were trained by conceptual map method for one month (8 sessions; 2 sessions weekly). At the end of eightieth session and one month later, subjects answered to teacher-made and performance tests again. Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance. Results: Findings showed that the conceptual map training method had positive effect on achievement of social-economic skill in students (p < 0.01). But, its effectiveness wasn't persistent after one month in follow-up test. Conclusion: Regarding to positive effects of conceptual map training method on meaningful learning, it seems as an effective method for intellectually disabled male students who require deep learning to understand the content of their lessons.";2013;;Iranian Rehabilitation Journal;11;17;46-52;;;;#10147;Pourmohamadreza-Tajrishi 2013;

Teaching Principles of Heredity to High School Students with Moderate and Severe Disabilities;"Riggs, Leah; Collins, Belva C.; Kleinert, Harold; Knight, Victoria F.";This investigation focused on the systematic instruction of a science skill from the core content standards in accordance with the Kentucky Alternate Assessment for students with moderate and severe disabilities (MSD). Specifically, this study examined the effectiveness of using a constant time delay procedure with multiple exemplars in teaching the principles of heredity (i.e., transmission of genetic information) to high school students with MSD. In addition, the study assessed whether or not students with MSD could draw conclusions based on meaningful related nontargeted information presented in the consequence of instructional trials during the science lesson and generalize both the target and nontargeted information to novel exemplars. The results of the multiple probe design replicated across five students with MSD show that the procedures were effective.

The Use of Trial-Based Functional Analysis in Public School Classrooms for Two Students with Developmental Disabilities;"Rispoli, Mandy J.; Davis, Heather S.; Goodwyn, Fara D.; Camargo, Siglia";Analogue functional analyses are a well-researched means of determining behavioral function in research and clinical contexts. However, conducting analogue functional analyses in school settings can be problematic and may lead to inconclusive results. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of a trial-based functional analysis with analogue functional analysis conducted within public school classrooms. Two individuals with developmental disabilities participated. Trial-based functional analyses produced clear behavioral functions for both participants, whereas analogue functional analysis results were inconclusive. Implications for practice and future research are presented. (Contains 2 figures.);2013;07-01;Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions;15;3;180-189;;;;#30681;Rispoli 2013;
Multimedia Shared Stories for Diverse Learners with Moderate Intellectual Disability;"Rivera, C.J.; Spooner, F.; Wood, C.L.; Hicks, S.C.";In recent years, there has been an increase in literature related to the development of literacy skills for students with intellectual disability (ID). By the same token, literature on ways to improve literacy skills for English language learners also has grown. Despite these advancements within the literature little is known about effective practices for English language learners with ID, specifically those who are Hispanic. The purpose of this study was to examine the comparative effects of an English and Spanish multimedia shared story intervention, with a constant time delay procedure, on the acquisition of English vocabulary for two English language learners with moderate ID. Instruction was provided to students for two weeks, lasting approximately 7–11 minutes per session. Results from the study suggested that language of instruction played an important role in English vocabulary acquisition. Results also indicated that language of instruction did not have a meaningful impact on generalization and maintenance of vocabulary for both conditions over time. Finally, teachers reported that multimedia shared stories were practical and a useful supplement for literacy instruction. © 2013 Technology and Media Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.;2013;;Journal of Special Education Technology;28;4;53-68;;10.1177/016264341302800405;;#9879;Rivera 2013;

A school-based intervention associated with improve-ments in cardiometaboiic risk profiles in young people with intellectual disabilities.;"Wallén, Eva Flygare; Müllersdorf, Maria; Christensson, Kyllike; Marcus, Claude";This study evaluates a multifactorial school-based intervention with the aim of decreasing cardio-metaboiic risk factors by means of a healthy lifestyle, primarily with daily physical activity and healthy food during school hours, at an upper secondary school for students with intellectual dis-abilities. The outcome is measured in terms of cardiometaboiic risk factors and cardiovascular fit-ness, both known to increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Two years of intervention resulted in a positive trend in several measured cardiometaboiic risk factors, with no increase in fat mass. Cardiovascular fitness levels were unchanged. We conclude that a healthy school environment can contribute to a deceleration of both fat mass gain and loss of cardiovascular fitness.

Enhancing activity by means of tactile symbols: A study of a heterogeneous group of pupils with congenital blindness, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder;"Aasen, G.; Nærland, T.";This study investigates responses to verbal versus tactile requests in children with congenital blindness, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Observation was conducted on two occasions. At T1, requests were given verbally, and at T2, tactile requests were given. All pupils perceived tactile symbols to be explicit requests to perform the act referred to by the symbols. The children seldom or never followed verbal requests. All children followed more tactile than verbal requests. Individual differences in verbal skills, motivations and the complexity of the activity are discussed. The availability of tactile symbols for individuals with congenital blindness, intellectual disability and ASD seems to increase their level of activity and their participation in school.© The Author(s) 2014.;2014;;Journal of Intellectual Disabilities;18;1;61-75;;10.1177/1744629514522142;;#13519;Aasen 2014;

Clinical report: A replication of the analysis of the reinforcing properties of hand mouthing;"Cannella-Malone, Helen Irene; O'Reilly, Mark F.";A reinforcing properties assessment was conducted with five participants with severe to profound intellectual disability to determine whether automatically maintained hand mouthing (as identified through an analogue functional analysis) was more specifically maintained by sensory stimulation to the mouth, hands, or both. Participants were provided free-access to one or two high preference items, and hand mouthing, hand-toy contact, and toy-mouth contact were measured. Results indicated that stimulation to the hand was the predominant reinforcer for all five participants, replicating the findings of Goh et al. (Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 28, 269–283 (1995)), suggesting that subsequent interventions should be tailored to specific maintaining variables.

Specially, this study sought to identify if video modeling on mobile technology could decrease adult prompting for students with intellectual disabilities during an in school transitions. The use of video modeling on mobile technology to increase speed and to increase task completion for students with intellectual disabilities during an in school transition is examined. Using a single subject, ABAB design, a video model with a peer as the model, was recorded and viewed on an iPod touch to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in an urban high school. Participants included four high school, male, African American students. The intervention was intended for three students and the fourth student served as model in the video. One student had a primary diagnosis of autism and the other two had a primary diagnosis of Down syndrome. Data were analyzed using visual inspection with mean, range, split middle average, variability, immediacy of effect and percent of overlapping data. Outcomes varied but there was an overall positive conclusion from the intervention. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

iPad® or iPod Touch®: Evaluating Self-Created Electronic Photographic Activity Schedules and Student Preferences;"Douglas, K.H.; Uphold, N.M.";Five secondary students with intellectual disability (ID) participated in a withdrawal design (A-B-A-B) study evaluating the effectiveness of a self-created electronic photographic activity schedule (ePAS). After learning to take photos of various activities using an iPod touch® or iPad®, students learned to use the First Then Visual Schedule application to self-manage task directives. The dependent variables included the percentage of tasks independently and correctly completed and the percentage of steps correctly completed when programming the device. Generalization data were collected in a different setting with different tasks and then using a second device. This study replicated Duttlinger, Ayres, Bevill-Davis, and Douglas (2013), which examined using a paper-based PAS. All five students learned to create and use their own ePAS within 7–12 instructional sessions and generalized their skills to a different setting and device. This research supports teaching students self-management skills that not only increase their independence in completing tasks but also decrease their reliance on others to provide self-management supports. © 2014 Technology and Media Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.;2014;;Journal of Special Education Technology;29;3;1-14;;10.1177/016264341402900301;;#13192;Douglas 2014;
The effects of skill training on preference for children with severe intellectual and physical disabilities;"Dutt, Anuradha S.; Berg, Wendy K.; Wacker, David P.; Ringdahl, Joel E.; Yang, Ling-Yan; Vinquist, Kelly M.; Zaman, Maliha";Some researchers have reported difficulties in identifying preferred items for individuals with severe intellectual and physical disabilities (SIPD), in part because these individuals often do not possess the motor skills needed to select and manipulate the items included within the assessments. The purpose of the current study was to address three research questions: a). Would differences in preference patterns occur between assessments that required an individual with SIPD to perform a motor response that was difficult for them to emit versus assessments that used an augmentative device (i.e., press a large microswitch) to activate the toy? b). Would teaching the specific skills needed to activate a toy result in an increase in toy engagement during preference assessment probes? and c) Would teaching the participant a motor response to directly activate the toy result in a shift in preference? Data were collected within a multielement (across conditions) design. The results of this study showed that (a) differences in preference patterns were observed when different motor responses were required to show preference between items, (b) acquisition of specific motor skills to activate a toy resulted in an increase in toy engagement during preference assessment probes that required direct toy manipulation, and (c) acquisition of motor skills also resulted in a shift in preference towards directly manipulating items versus activating items via microswitches.

The Possible Impact of Problem-Solving Method of Instruction on Exceptional Students' Creativity;"Fard, Adnan Eshrati; Bahador, Ali; Moghadam, Mahsa Nazemi; Rajabi, Hooman; Moradi, Alinoor Noor";The current study aimed at investigating the possible impact of the problem-solving method of instruction on the exceptional students' creativity. A sample of 50 male exceptional (Mild intellectual disability) students studying in the third grade of junior high school was chosen and divided into two equal groups. Both groups filled out the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) in pre- and post-test stages. They also completed the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) as a covariate variable. The results of covariance analysis revealed that the mean value for creativity score was higher for the students provided with the problem-solving method of instruction than that of their counterparts provided with the traditional method of instruction while the effect of intelligence was controlled. The scores obtained for the factors including fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration also increased through problem-solving method of instruction.;2014;07-01;Journal of Education and Training Studies;2;3;60-68;;;;#27238;Fard 2014;
The level of physical and social skills after completion of the training program for children aged 9–11;Francová, L.;"Objective: The objective of the study was to determine changes in physical and social indicators in participants of a table tennis training program lasting 10 months. Physical and social indicators were compared within two different research groups. Methods: Two research groups were created. The first one comprised beginners with intellectual disabilities and the reference group was created by non-disabled participants. Altogether 15 participants, aged 9–11, were included in each group. A pre-test was introduced at the beginning of the study and was followed by a posttest 10 months later. Physical parameters were evaluated with the help of individual skills tests designed for table tennis. The area of social indicators was determined according to the Scales for Assessing Coping Skills by Whelan and Speake (1979). Results: As far as physical indicators (e.g. individual skills used in table tennis) are concerned, individuals with intellectual disabilities improved by 24.5%. The improvement of non-disabled population reached 11%. Positive changes in social indicators, which include self-help socio-educational issues and interpersonal skills, were seen in individuals with intellectual disabilities – the improvement reached 7%; whereas the improvement in non-disabled participants was only 2%. The obtained results were evaluated separately for each group, due to the default level in pre-tests. Having compared the two groups we learnt that individuals with intellectual disabilities reached on average 63% of the non-disabled participants. Conclusions: The training programme has brought positive changes into the lives of individuals with intellectual disabilities in all of the studied parameters, social and physical skills included. In accord with our comparative findings it has been recommended to reduce sport demands to the observed level. Also, a number, of methodological skills required for table tennis, has been modified in accordance with our findings. Based on the results a set of games and exercises customized to the needs of the intellectually disabled individuals has been created. Within the study, we also transformed The Scales for Assessing Coping Skills by Whelan and Speake (1979) from English into Czech language. The transformed scale was used in both groups. The results of this study demonstrated positive development of social indicators within all of the selected areas in the group of children with intellectual disabilities. The whole study has confirmed the importance of physical activity for children in younger school age. © 2014 L. Francová.";2014;;Acta Gymnica;44;1;33-45;;10.5507/ag.2014.004;;#13340;Francová 2014;
Promoting resilience in children with intellectual disability: A randomized controlled trial in Australian schools;"Gilmore, Linda; Campbell, Marilyn; Shochet, Ian; Garland, Robyn; Smyth, Tanya; Roberts, Clare; West, Damian";Children with intellectual disability are more vulnerable to adverse developmental outcomes because of the lifelong risks associated with cognitive impairment. Difficulties with learning and adaptive behaviour inevitably produce considerable personal, social and economic disadvantage. Of concern is consistent evidence that psychiatric disorders affect a substantial proportion of people with intellectual disability. The estimated prevalence rate of between 35 and 49 % is three times that found in the general population (Wallander, Dekker, & Koot, 2006). Until recently, mental illness has been relatively neglected for people with intellectual disability, especially in relation to prevention or early detection (Kolaitis, 2008) and most research to date has been descriptive rather than focused on intervention (Bouras, 2013). Yet a considerable body of evidence demonstrates that efficacious interventions do exist for preventing psychopathology and enhancing resilience in typically developing children and adolescents (see Mallin, Walker, & Levin, 2013 for a review). In order to prevent the high comorbidity of intellectual disability and psychopathology, there is a compelling need for evidence-based practices that promote the resilience of individuals with intellectual disability (Matson, Terlonge, & Minshawi, 2008). In this chapter, we describe a randomized controlled trial of an intervention that was designed to enhance the resilience of a group of children with mild intellectual disability as they prepared to make the transition to high school. We report results from our evaluation of this intervention, and reflect on the difficulties of providing successful interventions for children whose lives are complicated not only by intellectual disability, but also by a range of contextual disadvantages.

Using Antecedent Physical Activity to Increase On-Task Behavior in Young Children:;"Luke, Sara E.; Vail, Cynthia O.; Ayres, Kevin M.";A withdrawal design was used to investigate how physical activity affects on-task behavior of young children with significant developmental delays in a special education preschool classroom. Five preschool age children with significant developmental delays engaged in either physical activity or seated center activities for 20 min prior to a 15-min teacher-directed group activity. Momentary time sampling was used to calculate the percentage of intervals the participants were on-task using 15-s intervals. Results indicated all of the participants’ on-task behavior was higher during the physical activity condition. These findings suggest physical activity may be used as a proactive behavioral intervention to improve the on-task behavior of young children with significant developmental delays during teacher-directed group activities.;2014;2014-06-06;Exceptional Children;80;4;489-503;;10.1177/0014402914527241;;#45333;Luke 2014;systematic_review_manual

Pedagogical-didactic training for an inclusive didactics: The precision teaching for strengthening of basic and integrating skills in intellectual disabilities;"Murdaca, A.M.; Cuzzocrea, F.; Oliva, P.; Larcan, R.";"In recent years, focused studies have highlighted increasingly the importance of using new technologies during the planning of educational and didactic paths to develop skills and functions in disabled patients. They deal with assistive technologies that represent real opportunities of e-participation and social life. They also work as scaffolding in order to promote developing processes for an inclusive didactics. This chapter moves in such direction: about the importance of technologies in mental retardation. This importance turns around the usability of many inputs, which can offer to disabled patients the possibility to exercise their cognitive styles, their own characteristics, and their own autonomies to increase motivation and self-esteem. A didactic application of educational software, based on Precision Teaching method, is proposed in order to: a) verify the effectiveness of this didactic software on learning of integrative skills and b) verify gender differences. For this study, 40 children were selected (20 boys and 20 girls) with and without mental retardation. Results show learning improvements in each group; in spite of students' difficulties, the use of Precision Teaching seems to have reduced significantly the initial cognitive gap, which refers to the number of correct responses (accuracy) and to response time (fluency) relative to the learning of how to use money. Finally, new perspectives of its pedagogical and rehabilitative application for students with special needs are also discussed. © 2014, IGI Global.

The importance of structured text talks for students' reading comprehension;Reichenberg, M.;The present intervention study reveals that students diagnosed with an intellectual disability (ID) are able to construct meaning from written expository text through guided social interaction. There were 31 students recruited from four special schools participating in this intervention study.The study involves a pre-test phase and a post-test phase. The students were divided into two intervention conditions: (a) reciprocal teaching (RT), which involved practice in four reading strategies- prediction, question generating, clarification, and summarisation-and (b) inference training IT), which involved practice in answering inference questions, i.e., where you have to read between the lines to find the answer. The training included 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Pre- testing and post-testing included seven tests. Improvement of test results was obtained in both conditions to about the same extent, indicating that both conditions were beneficial. © by Monica Reichenberg 2014.;2014;;Journal of Special Education and Rehabilitation;15;3-4;77-94;;10.2478/jser-2014-0012;;#13197;Reichenberg 2014;

The Effects of an iPad® Multimedia Shared Story Intervention on Vocabulary Acquisition for an English Language Learner;"Rivera, C.J.; Mason, L.; Moser, J.; Ahlgrim-Delzell, L.";The current research explored the use of a multimedia shared story to increase the number of correct English and Spanish vocabulary words used by an English language learner with a moderate intellectual disability. A 10-year-old elementary student in a self-contained special education classroom participated in this research. Utilizing the iBooks Author software, personalized shared stories were created on an iPad® for the participant in both English and Spanish. Each story incorporated pictures of items for which the student could not provide a corresponding vocabulary word in either language. The multimedia shared stories were then used to teach these vocabulary words in both English and Spanish. Results showed that the student initially acquired Spanish vocabulary words more quickly, but his English vocabulary words accelerated at a faster rate over the course of the investigation. To support the quantitative data, the students' teacher and paraprofessional were interviewed to determine their experiences and to discuss nuances that occurred over the course of the intervention. Results and implications for future research are discussed. © 2014 Technology and Media Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.;2014;;Journal of Special Education Technology;29;4;31-48;;10.1177/016264341402900403;;#13114;Rivera 2014;

Autism Research: Music Aptitude's Effect on Developmental/Academic Gains for Students with Significant Cognitive/Language Delays;Sobol, Elise S.;This research study was built upon findings in neuroscience of the brain's natural ability to physically change itself through cognitive modifiability by creating new pathways and neural connections. The purpose of the research was to investigate instructional music applications for improvement in basic math skills with students who are on the autism spectrum and have intellectual development disorder with significant cognitive/language delays. Seventy-seven (N = 77) high school-aged students from a center-based special education program in Nassau County, Long Island, participated in this mixed methodology study. A purposeful sample of six students was selected for case studies from the research participants. The eight-week study took place over the last marking period of the school year, May-June 2013 in the principal investigator's music classroom. Pre-tests and post-tests were given in two areas: music aptitude and mathematics. The Primary Measures of Music Audiation (PMMA) was used to test music aptitude. The New York State Common Core Learning Standards Math and Music Data Sheets were used to record quantitative and prompting measures of teacher-designed math tests. The following research questions guided this study. Can music aptitude be measured in students with significant cognitive/language delays including autism spectrum disorders? How does rhythmic and tonal training help students with significant cognitive/language delay, including autism spectrum disorders, make developmental/academic gains in basic math skills? What does teaching and learning look like in a MLE (mediated learning experience) special education music classroom? What other cross-curricular academic benefits can be evidenced by student work to indicate higher levels of independent functioning and cognitive understanding? Research findings through both inferential statistical and descriptive analysis of data point towards student improvement with standards-based classroom music instruction taught through mediated learning experiences. Significant growth towards functional independence was seen in pre- and post-basic math counting skills. Educational implications of the research represent a paradigm shift for expectations of this student population. The research opens possibilities for alternate ways to teach and to interact with students with intellectual disabilities on the autism spectrum in order to increase their learning capacity to reach curriculum content expectations.

Increasing choice-making and choice awareness for students with intellectual disability;Sparks, Shannon Lynn;"A number of studies have suggested that when children with disabilities are presented with choice-making opportunities, they can make choices (Bambara, 2004; Carlson, Luiselli, Slyman, & Markowski, 2008; Dibley & Lim, 1999; Manhertz, 2006). Teaching choice-making to students with intellectual disability is an important skill. Students with intellectual disability, when exposed to choice-making, tend to display these skills in future settings as they grow older (Lee, Palmer, Turnbull, & Wehmeyer, 2006). Choice-making research has been limited for high school students with mild to moderate intellectual disability (Dibley & Lim, 1999; Manhertz, 2006; Shevin & Klein, 2004). The purpose of this study was to determine if high school students with intellectual disability, when given choice training, would improve their choice selections. This study involved an investigation of choice-making instruction intervention with individuals with intellectual disability. The researcher used a multiple probe design with one replication for six students with intellectual disability. The study took place in one 9-12 public high school classroom. One specialized classroom with a special education teacher who served students with mild to moderate intellectual disability was used in this study. Students received daily instruction with choice-making scenarios using still picture photographs. Choice-making training scenarios embedded real life situations that teenagers face daily. Real life choice situations were (a) making a choice on how to tell a friend that you are going to attend his or her birthday party, (b) making a choice on what and how you will spend your money, and (c) making a choice on what to wear to a job interview. This study involved an investigation of daily life choices and choice-making options that high school age students are given everyday. Lastly, the maintenance of choice-making skills in high school age students with intellectual disability was explored. The results of this study will add to the choice-making body of literature. Additionally, this study provided strategies for teachers to implement choice-making with a variety of students with disabilities.

Engaging students with profound and multiple disabilities using humanoid robots;"Standen, P.; Brown, D.; Roscoe, J.; Hedgecock, J.; Stewart, D.; Galvez Trigo, M.J.; Elgajiji, E.";Engagement is the single best predictor of successful learning for children with intellectual disabilities yet achieving engagement with pupils who have profound or multiple disabilities (PMD) presents a challenge to educators. Robots have been used to engage children with autism but are they effective with pupils whose disabilities limit their ability to control other technology? Learning objectives were identified for eleven pupils with PMD and a humanoid robot was programmed to enable teachers to use it to help pupils achieve these objectives. These changes were evaluated with a series of eleven case studies where teacher-pupil dyads were observed during four planned video recorded sessions. Engagement was rated in a classroom setting and during the last session with the robot. Video recordings were analysed for duration of engagement and teacher assistance and number of goals achieved. Rated engagement was significantly higher with the robot than in the classroom. Observations of engagement, assistance and goal achievement remained at the same level throughout the sessions suggesting no reduction in the novelty factor. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.;2014;;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);8514 LNCS;PART 2;419-430;;10.1007/978-3-319-07440-5_39;;#13450;Standen 2014;

Modeling the effects of sensory reinforcers on behavioral persistence with alternative reinforcement;"Sweeney, Mary M.; Moore, Keira; Shahan, Timothy A.; Ahearn, William H.; Dube, William V.; Nevin, John A.";Problem behavior often has sensory consequences that cannot be separated from the target response, even if external, social reinforcers are removed during treatment. Because sensory reinforcers that accompany socially mediated problem behavior may contribute to persistence and relapse, research must develop analog sensory reinforcers that can be experimentally manipulated. In this research, we devised analogs to sensory reinforcers in order to control for their presence and determine how sensory reinforcers may impact treatment efficacy. Experiments 1 and 2 compared the efficacy of differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) versus noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) with and without analog sensory reinforcers in a multiple schedule. Experiment 1 measured the persistence of key pecking in pigeons, whereas Experiment 2 measured the persistence of touchscreen responses in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Across both experiments, the presence of analog sensory reinforcers increased the levels, persistence, and variability of responding relative to when analog sensory reinforcers were absent. Also in both experiments, target responding was less persistent under conditions of DRA compared to NCR regardless of the presence or absence of analog sensory reinforcers.

Simple and conditional discrimination and specific reinforcement in teaching reading: An intervention package;"Zaine, Isabela; Domeniconi, Camila; de Rose, Julio C.";This study evaluated an intervention package combining simple and conditional discrimination training and specific reinforcement for each stimulus class in teaching reading of simple words to individuals with intellectual disabilities. In conditional discrimination training, participants matched printed words and pictures to the recorded sounds made by the pictured objects and animals. Fourteen children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities were assigned to an experimental and a control group. The two groups’ performance did not differ in the pretest. The experimental group demonstrated equivalence class formation and read the words that participated in the equivalence classes, whereas the control group did not.

The iPad as an alternative reinforcer during Functional Communication Training: Effects on self-injury and aggression;Acotto, Catherine;The present study used a multiple baseline design across settings to examine the effects of using an iPad as an alternative reinforcer on self-injury and aggression when reinforcement for appropriate communication was denied following Functional Communication Training in an adolescent with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disability (ID), and severe aggression. The study also assessed collateral effects of the intervention on the use of self-management to control aggression. Data indicate the use of an iPad as an alternative reinforcer decreased the duration of self-injury and physical aggression in an adolescent in a big box store, grocery store, and classroom. Instances of self-injury and aggression remained low during maintenance sessions and a six month post-hoc analysis. Collateral gains in self-management were made during treatment and maintenance sessions.

The multistage cluster method was chosen to determine the sample. The Wechsler intelligence test for matching the groups interms of IQ and teacher-applied tests were used for all students to measure the progress of students in science. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that (a) there was a significant difference in the academic achievement scores of the groups after applying the intervention and (b) the mean difference in achievement scores for the tangible reinforcements group was significantly higher than the social reinforcement group and the control group. Also the mean scores for the social reinforcement group were significantly higher than the control group. © the author(s) 2014.;2015;;Journal of Intellectual Disabilities;19;1;83-93;;10.1177/1744629514559313;;#12915;Adibsereshki 2015;

Effectiveness of the all curriculum to teach basic literacy skills to groups of students with severe disabilities and complex communication needs;Ainsworth, Melissa Kay;"For students who have severe and multiple disabilities including intellectual disabilities, complex communication needs, physical and/or sensory disabilities, there are many barriers to literacy acquisition. Some barriers are a result of extensive support needs, some due to the attitudes and low expectations of parents, teachers, and administrators, and some are due to a general shortage of evidence-based research supporting effective instructional strategies for use with this student population (Agran, 2011; Bailey, Angell, & Stoner, 2011). However, literacy remains a ""critical component of an independent adult life"" (Downing, 2005, p. 12). Literacy also remains an elusive reality for many individuals with severe and multiple disabilities. The purpose of this study was to determine if middle school students who have significant intellectual disabilities and communication disorders could be taught basic literacy skills in small group settings using the ALL (Accessible Literacy Learning) curriculum. The target skills taught were letter-sound correspondence and sight word recognition. The ALL Curriculum was developed for learners with special needs including students with autism, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and multiple disabilities and is specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals who have difficulty with speech and may utilize augmentative and alternative (AAC) communication devices. This study employed a single-subject, multiple-baseline across groups and participants design and was replicated across two skill sets. Participants were individually assessed but the instruction was delivered in four small groups of two participants each for a total of eight total participants. The participants ranged in age from 11 to 16 years of age and had primary diagnoses of cerebral palsy, autism, Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, and intellectual disabilities. All of the participants were considered to be functionally nonverbal meaning that spoken language was not their primary means of communication. Findings from this study indicate that there is a statistically significant functional relation between use of the ALL Curriculum and participant progress toward letter-sound correspondence and sight word recognition. Each of the participants demonstrated increased treatment phase means over baseline means for each of the dependent variables. There were no differences noted between participants with a primary disability of intellectual disabilities and those with a primary disability of autism on either skill set. Further analysis of the data indicated that age, IQ score, and home language were not factors in determining the scope of participant progress in this study for these participants.

Teaching Algebraic Equations to Middle School Students with Intellectual Disabilities;"Baker, Joshua N.; Rivera, Christopher J.; Morgan, Joseph John; Reese, Noelle";"The purpose of this study was to replicate similar instructional techniques of Jimenez, Browder, and Courtade (2008) using a single-subject multiple-probe across participants design to investigate the effects of task analytic instruction coupled with semi-concrete representations to teach linear algebraic equations to middle school students with intellectual disabilities. Over the past decade, instructional strategies used to teach academics to students with intellectual disabilities have seen a dramatic change. Federal laws (e.g., IDEA, 1997; 2004) and state assessments have assisted in creating a balance of functional and academic instruction with this population. Data were analyzed using visual inspection and descriptive comparison between baseline and intervention phases for each student. Results suggest a functional relationship across all participants. Generalization measures and limitations are discussed.";2015;07-01;Journal of the American Academy of Special Education Professionals;;;1-11;;;;#26640;Baker 2015;
IntegraGame: A real-life inspired serious game for social and professional training of people with intellectual disability;"Bonet-Codina, N.; Von Barnekow, A.; Tost, D.";This paper describes IntegraGame a game for professional training and social empowerment of persons with intellectual disabilities. The game was designed based on a real case of professional integration, the InOut hostel near Barcelona, in which 90% of the personal has a disability. Integragame re- produces in 3D as realistically as possible the real hostel and presents several tasks to train cleaning procedures, vocab- ulary and social behavior. The game is adapted to a wide range of intellectual disability: it provides automatic navi- gation, uses verbal instructions and different types of visual assistance and feedback. It has been designed in narrow col- laboration with educators and managers. It has been tested by users throughout its development and evaluated with a group of students with ID. The results are positive show- ing that students could use the game, had fun with it and learned from it. © 2015 ACM.;2015;;;01-02-October-2015;;10-13;;10.1145/2838944.2838947;;#12696;Bonet-Codina 2015;
The effect of a numerical domino game on numerical magnitude processing in children with mild intellectual disabilities;"Brankaer, Carmen; Ghesquière, Pol; De Smedt, Bert";Children with mild intellectual disabilities (MID) appear to have particular problems in understanding the numerical meaning of Arabic digits. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a numerical domino game that specifically targeted the association between these digits and the numerical magnitudes they represent. Participants were 30 children with MID (M = 8.36 years), randomly assigned to either the numerical domino game or to a control color domino game. Findings revealed that both groups of children improved on a nonsymbolic comparison and arithmetic task. Most importantly, only children who played the numerical domino game became significantly faster from pretest to posttest on a symbolic comparison task. These findings suggest that numerical magnitude processing can be successfully trained in children with MID.

Implementation and Generalization of Peer Support Arrangements for Students With Severe Disabilities in Inclusive Classrooms;"Brock, Matthew E.; Biggs, Elizabeth E.; Carter, Erik W.; Cattey, Gillian N.; Raley, Kevin S.";Although research suggests peer support arrangements can be an effective practice for improving social outcomes for students with severe disabilities, additional efforts are needed to refine training and implementation approaches to increase the replicability and sustainability of this intervention. We tested a promising teacher-delivered training model using a multiple-probe-across-participants design. Four paraprofessionals received training to facilitate peer support arrangements for four middle school students with severe disabilities in general education classrooms. Teacher-delivered training enabled paraprofessionals to facilitate peer support arrangements that increased support from peers and interactions for students with disabilities. In addition, three of four students with disabilities demonstrated growth on individualized goals. We discuss implications for research and practice, highlighting approaches for improved implementation of peer support arrangements.;2015;2015-07-03;The Journal of Special Education;49;4;221-232;;10.1177/0022466915594368;;#44838;Brock 2015;
InSPAL: A Novel Immersive Virtual Learning Programme;"Byrne, J.; Ip, H.H.; Shuk-Ying Lau, K.; Chen Li, R.; Tso, A.; Choi, C.";In this paper we introduce The Interactive Sensory Program for Affective Learning (InSPAL) a pioneering virtual learning programme designed for the severely intellectually disabled (SID) students, who are having cognitive deficiencies and other sensory-motor handicaps, and thus need more help and attention in overcoming their learning difficulties. Through combining and integrating interactive media and virtual reality technology with the principles of art therapy and relevant pedagogical techniques, InSPAL aims to strengthen SID students' pre-learning abilities, promote their self-awareness, decrease behavioral interferences with learning as well as social interaction, enhance their communication and thus promote their quality of life. Results of our study show that students who went through our programme were more focused, and the ability to do things more independently increased by 15%. Moreover, 50% of the students showed a marked improvement in the ability to raise their hands in response, thus increasing their communication skills. The use of therapeutic interventions enabled a better control to the body, mind and emotions, resulting a greater performance and better participation.;2015;;Studies in health technology and informatics;219;;129-134;;;;#12976;Byrne 2015;

Overview of the enhanced natural gestures instructional approach and illustration of its use with three students with angelman syndrome;"Calculator, S.; Diaz-Caneja Sela, P.";Background: This investigation details procedures used to teach enhanced natural gestures (ENGs) and illustrates its use with three students with Angelman syndrome (AS). Materials and Methods: Themes were extracted, using a process of content analysis, to organize individuals' feedback pertaining to previous versions of the instructional programme. A 'B' case study design was then employed to follow administration of the modified programme with three students in Madrid, Spain. Programme impact was examined relative to changes in each student's uses of ENGs spontaneously and in response to non-specific verbal prompts, along with team members' responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate programme efficacy. Results: Two of the three students demonstrated particularly rapid and spontaneous uses of their ENGs. Both quantitative and qualitative feedback from teams supported programme efficacy for all three students. Conclusions: The approach appears viable for individuals with AS and has implications for individuals presenting other diagnoses as well. Additional educational/clinical and research implications are discussed. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;2015;;Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities;28;2;145-158;;10.1111/jar.12110;;#12931;Calculator 2015;
Use of continuous video prompting to teach a student with a significant disability;"Cannella-Malone, Helen Irene; Sabielny, Linsey M.; Jimenez, Eliseo D.; Page, E. Justin; Miller, Megan; Miller, Olivia";Video prompting has been demonstrated to be a successful procedure for teaching students with various disabilities to complete a variety of tasks. Traditionally, a video clip is only shown once before the student has an opportunity to engage in the step. Recent research has demonstrated that continuously showing the video in a loop can be an effective approach to video-based instruction. In the current study, we used a multiple probe across tasks design to evaluate the effects of continuous video prompting to teach a student with significant disabilities to complete three vocational tasks. Results demonstrated that continuous video prompting paired with error correction and additional training procedures was effective, although fading of the video prompts was not achieved. Areas for future research are addressed.

Concept Teaching to Mentally Retarded Students through Mobile Devices;Çengel, Metin;In the process of design, refinement and selection of the software required for mentally retarded students' education, the characteristics of students should be taken into consideration. Mobile application software can be used as a supplementary material in the education of students who need special education. Many studies reveal that computer assisted programs increase the motivation and concentration time of mentally retarded students and they enjoy studying with mobile devices (Tablets, Smartphones). Apart from ordinary students, mentally retarded students should also be provided with opportunities of technology in their education after developing technology gets into every aspect of the life and is also used in education. In this study, concept teaching based on animation and simulation is intended by making use of technology in the education of mentally retarded students. This process makes a valuable contribution to students in terms of concept learning at schools and rehabilitation centers which facilitate for learning by technology assisted visual programs. This study was conducted with 40 students at four schools of mentally retarded and rehabilitation centers in Sakarya. The evaluation of the data obtained from the application, students who have been learning the concepts of mobile learning tools revealed that they are more successful than those who had learned classical learning methods. According to these results, it can be said that mobile devices make a contribution to concept learning of mentally retarded students.;2015;09-01;TOJET: The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology spec iss;;;121-129;;;;#29545;Çengel 2015;unclear

Program of arithmetic improvement by means of cognitive enhancement: An intervention in children with special educational needs;"Deaño, M.D.; Alfonso, S.; Das, J.P.";This study reports the cognitive and arithmetic improvement of a mathematical model based on the program PASS Remedial Program (PREP), which aims to improve specific cognitive processes underlying academic skills such as arithmetic. For this purpose, a group of 20 students from the last four grades of Primary Education was divided into two groups. One group (n=. 10) received training in the program and the other served as control. Students were assessed at pre and post intervention in the PASS cognitive processes (planning, attention, simultaneous and successive processing), general level of intelligence, and arithmetic performance in calculus and solving problems. Performance of children from the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group in cognitive process and arithmetic. This joint enhancement of cognitive and arithmetic processes was a result of the operationalization of training that promotes the encoding task, attention and planning, and learning by induction, mediation and verbalization. The implications of this are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;2015;;Research in Developmental Disabilities;38;;352-361;;10.1016/j.ridd.2014.12.032;;#12933;Deaño 2015;

Increasing the Social Communication of a Boy With Autism Using Animal-assisted Play Therapy: A Case Report;Fung, S.C.;CONTEXT: Although research has shown that animal-assisted play therapy (AAPT) is associated with increased positive social behaviors in children with autism, the related literature on AAPT and autism is very limited. OBJECTIVES: The study tested the effectiveness of AAPT in increasing the social communication of a boy with autism. The treatment's effects on specific types of social communication were also investigated. DESIGN: An A-B-A single-subject design was adopted to examine treatment effectiveness. Follow-up assessments were made at 1 mo posttreatment. SETTING: The videotaped treatment sessions were held in the multipurpose room of the participant's school. PARTICIPANT: A 7-y-old boy who had a diagnosis of autism and mild-grade intellectual disability participated in the study. INTERVENTION: AAPT was implemented in 20-min sessions held 3 ×/wk. The 14 AAPT sessions occurred in 4 phases, covering child-dog relationship building and interaction in the presence of the therapist, with the diminishing presence of the dog occurring in phase 4. OUTCOME MEASURES: Naturally occurring social behaviors were measured in 3 baseline sessions, during the 14 AAPT sessions, during 3 posttreatment sessions, and again during 3 follow-up sessions. Momentary time sampling was used to estimate the frequency of target behaviors, using a 15-s interval. Behavioral categories were checked at every interval during each 20-min session in all 23 sessions. RESULTS: The study showed that the boy's social communication increased during treatment and remained higher than baseline at follow-up. An analysis of specific types of social communication showed that the benefits of AAPT were most apparent in the joint-attention and waiting behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide support for using AAPT as an intervention to facilitate the social communication of children with autism.;2015;;Advances in mind-body medicine;29;3;27-31;;;;#12829;Fung 2015;missing full-text
Teaching students with developmental disabilities daily living skills using point-of-view modeling plus video prompting with error correction;"Gardner, S.J.; Wolfe, P.S.";A primary goal of instruction for students with developmental disabilities is to enhance their future quality of life by promoting skill acquisition, which will enable them to live, function, and participate in the community. One instructional method that can help students with developmental disabilities improve independence in performing daily living skills is video prompting (VP). This study investigated the effectiveness of a VP plus error correction procedure on skill acquisition when teaching daily living skills to four adolescents with mild and moderate developmental disabilities. A multiple baseline across participants design demonstrated that all four participants rapidly acquired dish washing skills upon introduction of the intervention. Future research should further explore the efficacy of error correction procedures used with VP and the impact that these procedures have on student learning and skill retention. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2014.;2015;;Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities;30;4;195-207;;10.1177/1088357614547810;;#12651;Gardner 2015;

The effect of curriculum based measurement, student consultation, and goal setting on related student reading outcomes and duration of daily reading instruction for students with intellectual disability;Hill, David Ryan;Students with intellectual disability (ID) have continued to struggle with reading achievement despite recent accountability measures and high academic expectations for all students. Several researchers have started to explore the use of phonics based reading interventions with students with ID and the results are promising. The purpose of this study was to extend the previous research on phonics based reading interventions by examining the effects of teachers’ use of reading curriculum based measurement (CBM) combined with student consultation and goal setting on related student reading outcomes and amount of provided daily reading instruction. Teachers were trained to administer CBM and also learned to interpret CBM data so they could monitor reading goals and make appropriate instructional changes for participating students. Three teachers administered weekly CBM to four eligible students with ID and monitored data for 16 consecutive weeks. Participating teachers consulted with each participating student weekly to share previous CBM scores, provide encouragement and to highlight weekly reading goals. A multiple baseline across participants design was used to display and interpret visual data. Findings revealed that all four students increased his or her weekly reading fluency and accuracy but there was no functional relation established between intervention and improved reading across students. However, weekly minutes of reading instruction increased during intervention for three of the four students. Directions for future research are discussed, as are limitations and implications for practitioners.

Interactive Whiteboards, Students with Intellectual Disability and Oral Language Production;Le Lant, Carol;The focus of this research was to examine the impact of the use of interactive whiteboards (IWB) on the engagement of students with intellectual disability in early reading lessons. Case studies of five students with intellectual disability were carried out using an alternating treatments design. Detailed coding of video recordings of lessons was carried out at 30-second intervals across 10 lessons in each of the IWB and traditional desk-top lessons. All students acquired knowledge in the aspect of reading taught. Upon analysis of the levels of engagement, no consistent pattern of difference was observed between the lessons using an IWB and those taught using a more traditional desk-top style delivery. However, the extent of oral language production during lessons did differ between the two conditions, with there being evidence of a higher level of relevant verbal elaborations in the lessons taught away from the IWBs. This result is important as production of language, particularly elaborated or connected language, helps to build knowledge networks and deepen understanding of the task and therefore comprehension. The elaborated language in the non-IWB lessons was found to be up to twice that of the IWB lessons.;2015;12-03;Australian Association for Research in Education;;;1-7;;;;#30753;LeLant 2015;

Teaching shape recognition to students with significant intellectual disabilities;Lyon, Kristin Joannou;Little research on teaching mathematics to students with significant intellectual disabilities exists, and that which does exist is largely in the areas of number and money skills. All students, including students with significant intellectual disabilities, need mathematics skills to lead productive and independent lives. Geometry skills help students make sense of the world around them. Mastery of shape recognition is a beginning geometry skill that is necessary for progressing to more advanced topics in geometry. The purpose of this study was to teach beginning shape recognition skills by combining evidence-based practices in shape recognition instruction with best practices in teaching mathematics to students with significant intellectual disabilities. This study utilized a small sample, interrupted time series (single-case) multiple-probe design across four behaviors that were (a) matching identical shapes, (b) matching shapes that are different sizes, (c) matching shapes that have different orientations, and (d) shape recognition. Although no students reached mastery criteria, all students showed some improvement, and much was learned regarding teaching mathematics to students with significant intellectual disabilities. Limitations, suggestions for future research, and the implications of these findings are discussed.

Effects of Picture Activity Schedules on Tasks Completed;Morrisett, Michael Eric;"Self-determination is the freedom to make choices that impact an individual's life. Many people would agree that self-determination leads to an enhanced quality of life, and choice making is considered a central element in self-determination. Most learn choice making through a gradual release of responsibility by caregivers throughout their childhood and adolescence. Many times, this is not the case for students with autism. Completed research examining choice making and people with autism has shown promising results; however, one of the primary traits of autism, the need for structured routines, often does not lend itself to evaluating choice making. Activity schedules are one way to incorporate choice making into an already structured routine, providing a schedule for daily events or specific routines. Choice making is embedded in activity schedules when people are allowed to choose the sequence of events within the schedule. Past research has suggested activity schedules to be an effective way to teach task completion to people across disability areas. The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend a previously completed study by Duttlinger, Ayres, Bevill-Davis, and Douglas (2013), which evaluated the effects of activity schedules on task completion by middle school students with intellectual disabilities, in two ways. First, this study evaluated the use of activity schedules with four middle school students with autism; second, it evaluated the effects of choice making on the number of tasks completed in sequence. Ten skills all participants could complete independently were identified by the participating teacher and researcher using the participant's Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals as a guide. An alternating treatments design with initial baseline and final best treatment phase was implemented, evaluating the difference in the number of tasks completed between teacher and participant selection of the order of tasks. The researcher collected data on the number of tasks completed, the number of tasks completed in sequence, the fidelity of implementation, reliability of data, and social validity. Suggestions are made for practice and research based on the limited study outcomes. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

Using video prompting to teach high school students with moderate intellectual disabilities a vocational skill with a portable video delivery system employing a qualitative case study;Newman, John H.;The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of portable video devices in the delivery of video content using video prompting to teach functional life skills to three high school students with moderate intellectual disabilities. The theoretical frameworks of the social learning theory, anchored instruction, and situated cognition show promise as the foundation of the development of specialized curricula to improve students' functioning in adaptive behavior skills. The study utilized a qualitative case study approach, using a multiple-probe across tasks and a single-subject design to obtain quantitative data as the first data collection strategy for a qualitative case study. Additional data were collected for triangulation, in the form of a parent survey and a student questionnaire. The video content was delivered utilizing an iPod to allow the participants to view the content in a variety of venues, thus increasing the independence of the participants. Data were visually analyzed using graphs of the results obtained from independent completion of a vocational task. Using video prompting with an iPod was found to be effective when it is utilized with other educational methods to reinforce the task presented.

Benefits of extending and adjusting the level of difficulty on computerized cognitive training for children with intellectual disabilities;"Ottersen, Jon; Grill, Katja M.";Training on working memory (WM) improves attention and WM in children with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder and memory impairments. However, for children with intellectual disabilities (ID), the results have been less encouraging. In this preliminary study it was hypothesized that children with ID would benefit from an extended amount of training and that the level of difficulty during training would affect the outcome. We included 21 children with mild or moderate ID aged 8–13 years. They went through between 37 and 50 training sessions with an adaptive computerized program on WM and non-verbal reasoning (NVR). The children were divided into two subgroups with different difficulty levels during training. The transfer to untrained cognitive tests was compared to the results of 22 children with ID training only 25 sessions, and to a control group. We found that the training group with the extended training program improved significantly on a block design task measuring NVR and on a WM task compared to the control group. There was also a significantly larger improvement on block design relative to the training group with the shorter training time. The children that received easier training tasks also improved significantly more on a verbal WM task compared to children with more demanding tasks. In conclusion, these preliminary data suggest that children with ID might benefit from cognitive training with longer training periods and less demanding tasks, compared to children without disabilities.

Effects of schema-based instruction delivered through computer-based video instruction on mathematical word problem solving of students with autism spectrum disorder and moderate intellectual disability;Saunders, Alicia Fern;The Common Core State Standards initiative calls for all students to be college and career ready with 21st century skills by high school graduation, yet the question remains how to prepare students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and moderate intellectual disability (ID) with higher order mathematical concepts. Mathematical problem solving is a critical, higher order skill that students need to have in order to solve real-world problems, but there is currently limited research on teaching problem solving to students with ASD and moderate ID. This study investigated the effects of schema-based instruction (SBI) delivered through computer-based video instruction (CBVI) on the acquisition of mathematical problem solving skills, as well as the ability to discriminate problem type, to three elementary-aged students with ASD and moderate ID using a single-case multiple probe across participants design. The study also examined participant's ability to generalize skills to a paper-and-pencil format. Results showed a functional relation between SBI delivered through CBVI and the participants' mathematical word problem solving skills, ability to discriminate problem type, and generalization to novel problems in paper-and-pencil format. The findings of this study provide several implications for practice for using CBVI to teach higher order mathematical content to students with ASD and moderate ID, and offers suggestions for future research in this area.

The effectiveness of emotional intelligence training on communication skills in students with intellectual disabilities;"Sheydaei, M.; Adibsereshki, N.; Movallali, G.";Objectives: Emotional intelligence skills begin at home, and with positive interactions with parents and other children. Parents can help children recognize their emotions, name them, and learn how to respect their feelings and adapt to social situations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of emotional intelligence training on the communication skills of students with intellectual disabilities. Methods: This study was quasi-experimental, with a pre-test, post-test design and a control group. The sample consisted of 32 educable students with intellectual disabilities (14-18 years old). Results: The results showed that the intervention program had created a significant difference between the scores of the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05), and that the scores for communication skills were increased, both post-test and also in the experimental group follow-up (P < 0.05). Discussion: Emotional intelligence training enhanced the communication skills of students with intellectual disabilities. Teachers, professionals, and clinicians could use these training in their practices.;2015;;Iranian Rehabilitation Journal;13;3;7-12;;;;#12970;Sheydaei 2015;
Evaluating the effects of a video prompt in a system of least prompts procedure;"Smith, K.A.; Ayres, K.M.; Mechling, L.C.; Alexander, J.L.; Mataras, T.K.; Shepley, S.B.";The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a system of least prompts procedure with a video prompt serving as the model in teaching office tasks to three high school students with moderate intellectual disability. A multiple probe across behaviors design replicated across participants was used to evaluate the intervention. The dependent variable was percentage of steps completed independently on collating and stapling papers, organizing a binder, and preparing a letter. Generalization was assessed across materials for each participant in a pre-/post-test format. Results indicated the three participants learned all three skills after the introduction of intervention and generalized the majority of steps to novel materials. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2013.;2015;;Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals;38;1;39-49;;10.1177/2165143413511981;;#12855;Smith 2015;

A board game for the teaching, reading, and writing to intellectually disabled people;"Tripiana-Barbosa, Andressa; de Souza, Silvia Regina";In this study we investigated the effect of a board game on the teaching of reading and writing of 6 intellectually disabled individuals. A pretest was performed, and we evaluated the relationship among printed words, spoken words, and pictures and between spoken words and a group of syllables. In addition, a pretest was conducted to determine the preexperimental writing repertoire of the participants. After the pretest, the intervention/game allowed the teaching of the relationship among printed words, spoken words, a group of syllables, and pictures. A probe was run after every 2 sessions, and a follow-up session was performed after a month. Despite the increase in the percentage of words read correctly, correctly chosen syllables, correct matching between figures and printed words, and correctly written syllables, the variability in the performance observed suggested the need for further investigation.

Teaching Early Reading Skills to Children with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Using Computer-Delivered Instruction: A Pilot Study;"Tyler, Emily J.; Hughes, John C.; Wilson, Meadhbh M.; Beverley, Michael; Hastings, Richard P.; Williams, Bethan M.";"Many children with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) have considerable difficulty learning basic reading skills. Increasing evidence suggests individuals with IDD may benefit from instruction incorporating components of reading found to be effective for typically developing children. However, little research into reading instruction for children with IDD has incorporated these components. There is evidence for the efficacy of Headsprout® ""Early Reading"" program for typically developing children, and emerging evidence suggesting that children with autism can benefit from the program. The current study investigated the accessibility of Headsprout® ""Early Reading"" for children with IDD, and whether there were any measurable effects of the program on important early reading and language skills. Six children aged between 7 and 14 years with mild to moderate IDD completed the program, and all made measurable improvements across reading measures, demonstrating children with mild to moderate IDD can access (i.e., progress through and benefit from) the program.";2015;03-01;Journal of International Special Needs Education;18;1;1-11;;;;#30281;Tyler 2015;

Effects of systematic instruction on listening comprehension of science e-texts for students with moderate intellectual disability;Wood, Alyson Leah;A multiple probe across participants design was used to examine the effects of systematic instruction (constant time delay and a system of least prompts) on both generating and answering questions about science e-texts for students with moderate intellectual disability. Three elementary aged students with moderate intellectual disability participated in this study. Two special education teachers served as the primary interventionists. The students were pretrained using constant time delay and visual and auditory cues delivered on an iPad2™ to access and navigate e-texts on the Internet. The primary dependent variable was the number of comprehension questions correctly answered after students generated a question and listened to a science e-text. Additional questions examined (a) the students' ability to generate questions both with and without the superport of an iPad2™ template, (b) the generalizability of generating questions and answering questions about science e-texts in a general education science setting, and (c) stakeholder perceptions. A functional relationship was demonstrated for both generating questions using an iPad2™ and answering comprehension questions. All three students demonstrated an ability to correctly answer questions by either saying an answer from memory or independently searching the e-text and replaying target text to find the correct answer. A functional relationship also was demonstrated between constant time delay instruction and the points earned accurately generating questions using an iPad2™.

The Effect of a Mobile Mathematical Game on the Mathematic Learning of the Student with Intellectual Disability;"Wu, C.-P.; Liu, Y.-C.";Taking into account of students with intellectual deficits and special needs in concept learning, this research designed a digital game for a fourth grade elementary student with mild intellectual disability to learn the concept of triangle. The participant's experience of learning from the game and the impact of the game on his learning gains on the introduced concepts of triangle were explored. This study adopted the A-B-A' research design of the single-subject model. One 4th grade elementary student with intellectual disability was recruited as the research participant. The experiment included three stages: The baseline, the intervention, and the retention. The participant's level of satisfaction towards the game was collected via observation and interview using the game satisfaction questionnaire. Moreover, the participant's performance on the tests embedded in the game was collected throughout the experiment. Two major conclusions are obtained. The participant is satisfied with digital game-based learning process. The designed digital game is effective in helping elementary students with intellectual disabilities to learn the concepts of triangle.;2015;;;;;105-109;;;;#12974;Wu 2015;

Teaching Arithmetic Combinations of Multiplication and Division to Students with Learning Disabilities or Mild Intellectual Disability: The Impact of Alternative Fact Grouping and the Role of Cognitive and Learning Factors;"Agaliotis, Ioannis; Teli, Afroditi";The effectiveness of two instructional interventions was investigated in the context of teaching Arithmetic Combinations (ACs) of multiplication and division to students with Learning Disabilities (LD) or Mild Intellectual Disability (MID). The intervention for the control group (LD = 20, MID = 10) was based on principles of effective instruction, while the intervention for the experimental group (LD = 19, MID = 4) combined the intervention for the control group and an alternative grouping and presentation scheme of ACs. Correlations between cognitive and learning characteristics of the two disability categories and participants' performance in ACs learning were also investigated. Intra-group comparisons showed that post-intervention performance of both groups (control and experimental) was significantly higher than their pre-intervention performance. However, inter-group comparisons revealed that there was no significant difference between the results obtained through the two interventions. Students with LD outperformed their counterparts with MID. Differences of the two disability categories in domains such as speed of information processing and counting skills correlated with performance. Results are discussed in reference to the organization of effective intervention programs for supporting students with LD or MID in their effort to learn arithmetic combinations of multiplication and division.;2016;01-01;Journal of Education and Learning;5;;90-103;;;;#28643;Agaliotis 2016;

Teaching menstrual care skills to intellectually disabled female students;"Altundağ, Sebahat; Çalbayram, Nazan Çakırer";Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to teach pad replacement skills to intellectually disabled adolescent female students during their menstruation periods by demonstrating on a dummy. Background: It may be difficult to make intellectually disabled adolescents achieve self‐care during menstruation. In addition, there are difficulties experienced in explaining menstruation, such as physical changes and the practice of cleaning during this period. Design: The study used a ‘One group pretest and post‐test model’. Method: The study was performed in a special educational institution. The population consisted of 77 female students in the high school section. Calculation of a sample size was not attempted, and 54 students with no attendance issues agreed to take part in the study and were included. Results: In this work, we found that pad replacement training significantly changed the scores of mentally disabled adolescents before and after training. Our training yielded positive results, and the population improved their skills at all stages of skill building. Conclusion: Training adolescents with mental disabilities helped them gain hygiene habits. Performance of these trainings occurs at the beginning of menstrual hygiene education. Relevance to clinical practice: To achieve improved success in life, it is important that adolescents assume the responsibility of self‐care and manage sustained care activity on their own.

A comparison of humanoid and non humanoid robots in supporting the learning of pupils with severe intellectual disabilities;"Aslam, S.; Shopland, N.; Standen, P.J.; Burton, A.; Brown, D.";Previous research has shown that the humanoid NAO robot can enhance learning as well as improve communication in children with intellectual disabilities. However, most special needs schools cannot afford the humanoid NAO robot due to high costs. Could a cheaper nonhumanoid Lego Mindstorm robot be an alternative way of achieving the same learning objectives as the humanoid NAO robot? A single case study experimental ABAB design was used consisting of 16 sessions over 5 weeks: eight with the humanoid and eight with the non-humanoid robot. All sessions were video recorded and analysed for percentage engagement and percentage errors made by each of four students. For each student individually, these outcome measures were then compared between the two conditions. The teachers were interviewed at the end of the study. Three out of four students were significantly more engaged with the non-humanoid robot than the humanoid robot, whilst one student was found to be equally engaged with both robots. There was no significant difference between the two robots in terms of percentage errors for all four participants who managed to complete the study. © 2016 IEEE.;2016;;;;;7-12;;10.1109/iTAG.2016.9;;#12168;Aslam 2016;

The effectiveness of the TEACCH approach in supporting the development of communication skills for learners with severe intellectual disabilities;Butler, C.;This research focused on whether a TEACCH-based approach could be effective in helping to develop the communication skills of older learners with Severe Intellectual Disabilities, to enhance their ability to communicate, to enhance their abilities to live independent lives, and to take part in discussions about their future. A TEACCH based approach was implemented in a class in a special school, attended by six students, aged over 16, all of whom had Severe Intellectual Disabilities. Using a pre-post quasi-experimental design P-Scale data and IEP targets were used as measures of progress for communication skills. These were supplemented by regular researcher observations of the communication skills of the students. Staff were also asked to regularly measure the frequency and effectiveness of communication skills. Parents were also interviewed. P-scale and IEP targets indicated some progress being made across the two years. The results from research and staff observation were more striking however, indicating the development of frequent and effective communication skills across the two years. Importantly, these communications were occurring spontaneously, rather than being the result of conversations initiated by staff. Parents had noticed changes in their children's communication, but remained concerned about their prospects for the future. This research showed that a TEACCH-based method can be effective in developing communication skills in learners with Severe Intellectual Disabilities. The extent of the effectiveness remains unclear however, as the school-based methods for assessing progress for these learners (mainly p-scales) remain problematic. © 2016 NASEN;2016;;Support for Learning;31;3;185-201;;10.1111/1467-9604.12128;;#12330;Butler 2016;
Using an Augmented Reality Enhanced Tabletop System to Promote Learning of Mathematics: A Case Study with Students with Special Educational Needs.;"Cascales-Martínez, Antonia; Martínez-Segura, María-José; Pérez-López, David; Contero, Manuel";Background:Learning applied mathematics is very important for people with special educational needs (SEN). SEN students cannot fully benefit from mathematics instruction and curriculum in general education classrooms. Technology can adapt and individualize mathematics instruction for SEN students. Researchers and teachers in the field of special education have made efforts to incorporate technology into math curricula for these students to improve their results.Material and methods:The tabletop system was used in a real educational setting, where we compared the learning experience of the students before and after using the tabletop. The evaluation method focused on three elements: the increase of knowledge, the relationship between the acquired learning and the type of educational needs, and the student’s satisfaction and motivation after using the tabletop.Results:The study provides evidence to suggest several reasons why the tabletop instructional effectiveness is higher than that using traditional methods. The tabletop is shown as a new technology-based artifact which offers new ways of interacting with the European monetary system, and using technology as an “object-to-think-with”, It also increases the motivation of students as well as the collaboration between them.Conclusions:Our results reveal that the tabletop is a feasible technology that can be successfully applied in special educational needs contexts.;2016;2016-12-01;EURASIA Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education;13;2;355-380;;10.12973/eurasia.2017.00621a;;#45029;Cascales-Martínez 2016;systematic_review_manual

Self-Monitoring for High School Students With Disabilities.;"Clemons, Lachelle L.; Mason, Benjamin A.; Garrison-Kane, Linda; Wills, Howard P.";Self-monitoring interventions are well supported within the empirical literature as improving classroom engagement for students with disabilities. However, studies implementing self-monitoring interventions in high school settings are rarely conducted despite their potential to improve student academic and behavioral outcomes. In an investigation of an unobtrusive, self-monitoring application loaded on a handheld device, classroom engagement and perceived academic benefits were assessed in a withdrawal design for three high school students with different disabilities (specific learning disability, autism, and intellectual disability) in varied instructional arrangements. Direct observation data supported the intervention as effective in improving classroom engagement for all three students during intervention and maintenance phases.

Exploring cognitively accessible academic lessons for students with intellectual disabilities using the iPad;Gunderson, Jamie Linn;Students with intellectual disabilities often lack access to general education curricula. This is because many teachers struggle with adapting these curricula to meet the unique learning needs of these students. Technology, having the potential to facilitate access to general education curricula, has been successfully used as a tool to adapt curriculum for this population. The use of the iPad (Apple, 2010), which is easily programmed to support the unique needs of students with disabilities, is beginning to be explored as a tool for the learning and instruction of students with intellectual disabilities and results have been favorable. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of using iPad (Apple, 2010) technology as a curricular support and methods for successfully incorporating this technology into instruction must also be explored. This study focused on providing access to academic content aligned to general education content standards through the use of an iPad (Apple, 2010). Two instructional conditions were compared, traditional teaching involving paper and pencil and teaching involving iPad (Apple, 2010) technology. Data were compared to determine the effects of the intervention on the academic content knowledge, work completion, and engagement of students with intellectual disabilities. Student perceptions concerning the use of iPads (Apple, 2010) as learning tools were collected and evaluated at the conclusion of the study. The results indicated that although the iPad (Apple, 2010) did not have a significant effect on increasing the academic content knowledge or maintenance of knowledge over time, the iPad (Apple, 2010) did have a significant effect on the work completion and engagement of students with intellectual disabilities. Moreover, students participating in the study responded favorably about using the iPad (Apple, 2010) as a learning tool.

The effects of direct instruction on reading comprehension for individuals with autism or intellectual disability;Head, Cynthia Nelson;This study investigated the effects of a Direct Instruction (DI) reading comprehension program on the reading comprehension skills of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability. Although the effectiveness of DI programs has been well documented in disability and instructional literature, effectiveness of DI for individuals with autism and intellectual disability is sparse. This study examined the effects of Corrective Reading Comprehension: B1, a reading comprehension program, on students' acquisition of specific reading comprehension skills (parts of speech, combining sentences with and, identifying contradictions, and identifying relevant/irrelevant information). A single subject multiple-probe across behaviors design was employed to investigate whether a functional relation existed between DI and reading comprehension for this sample. A functional relation between the DI and reading comprehension was demonstrated for each participant across all behavioral conditions. Additional data were collected in the area of reading comprehension using standardized and curriculum-based measures. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

The effectiveness of Colourful Semantics on narrative skills in children with intellectual disabilities in Sri Lanka;Hettiarachchi, S.;Background: Children diagnosed with intellectual difficulties experience difficulties with narrative skills, due to limited syntactic knowledge. The Colourful Semantics approach with thematic roles and a colour coding system may encourage syntactic development in children experiencing intellectual disabilities. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of using the Colourful Semantics approach to develop narrative skills in Sri Lankan Tamil-speaking children diagnosed with intellectual difficulties. Methods: Thirty Sri Lankan Tamil-speaking children identified with intellectual difficulties were included. The Colourful Semantics approach was offered twice a week for 6 weeks, facilitated by the class teachers. Pre- and post-intervention narrative skill assessments were undertaken and analysed for content and syntactic structures. Results: The results indicate positive changes post-intervention on the qualitative and quantitative narrative skills measures undertaken on content and syntactic structures. Conclusions and Implications: The Colourful Semantics approach is an effective therapy approach to support development of narrative skills in children with intellectual difficulties. © The Author(s) 2015.;2016;;Journal of Intellectual Disabilities;20;1;18-33;;10.1177/1744629515591410;;#12444;Hettiarachchi 2016;
Effects of Wii Fit® balance game training on the balance ability of students with intellectual disabilities;Hsu, T.-Y.;[Purpose] The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 8 weeks of Wii Fit balance game training on the balance abilities of students with intellectual disabilities. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four students with intellectual disabilities were selected and randomly divided into Wii Fit balance game training, physical education, and sedentary activity groups. The Wii Fit balance game training group received two 40-minute Wii Fit balance game training sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to compare differences. [Results] After eight weeks of training, the Wii Fit balance game training group showed significant differences between the pre-and post-training parameters, including the duration of standing on one leg with the eyes closed, average anteroposterior movement speed, swing area per unit time, and speed strength index. The physical education group showed significant differences between the pre-and post-training speed strength index values. The sedentary activity group did not show any significant differences between the pre-and post-training parameters. [Conclusion] Wii Fit balance game training can improve static balance and lower extremity muscle strength in students with intellectual disabilities. © 2016 The Society of Physical Therapy Science.

Correspondence training using special interests to increase compliance during transitions: An emerging technology;"Huffman, Robert W.; Sainato, Diane M.; Curiel, Emily S. L.";It is noted that although previous research findings for correspondence training validate interventions for increasing desired behaviors such as social skills and task-on-behaviors, research is still limited on using correspondence training to facilitate independent performance during classroom transition. A treatment package was developed to increase the participant's overall compliance and on-task behavior during transitions. The study was conducted in an inclusive half-day pre-school classroom that was in session 4 days a week. Five children with developmental de-lays and five of their peers comprised the classroom group.The participant in this study was a 6-year-old boy named Matt who was diagnosed with Down syndrome. This study was conducted during three daily classroom transitions, in which Matt exhibited high rates of non-compliance. These were the cleanup time after free play,hand washing before snack, and the transition from group instruction to table work. Outcomes from this study suggest that the incorporation of special interests into correspondence training and/or task analytic visual cues may be an effective modification to these interventions for individuals who engage in a high frequency of preservative behaviors related to a special interest character.

The Effect of Training Individuals with Mild Intellectual Disability in Scaffolding Strategies and Computer Software on Their Generalization Skills;"Jalloul, Farah; EL-Daou, Badrie";"Objective: The study aimed at investigating the effect of scaffolding strategies as thinking out loud and verbalization of instructions strategies on the generalization skills of language-related concepts in mildly intellectual disabled students. Method: Twenty-seven subjects in three treatments were trained in solving a pattern of the Thurston letter series task. Group 1 students received language concepts through training in verbal instructions and thinking out loud strategy. Group 2 students received language concepts training through computers. Group 3 students received training in language concepts through thinking out loud, verbal instructions and computer software. Pre-training measures to subjects' chronological age, Verbal Analogies Test and training trials were collected. Training measures pertaining to acquisition, maintenance and generalization of pattern completion tasks were collected. Mean scores and standard deviations were obtained for each dependent measure. Results: The treatment effect was studied by a series of one way ANOVAS and a Tukey ""post hoc"" test, which revealed that there was a significant difference between group 1 and group 2, since the difference between the means (m1-m3) = -2.556 and p = 0.000. Also, the difference is shown between group 2 and group 3 since the difference between the means (m2-m3) = -2.333 and p = 0.000 and in both cases p is less than 0.05. Moreover, group 3 had a higher mean (M = 3.89) than group 2 (M = 1.56) and group 1 (M = 1.33). Conclusion: Group 3 had the ability to become self-regulated by solving the untrained letter patterns. Thus, we can conclude that training in scaffolding strategies, such as thinking out loud and verbalization of instruction strategies, helped individuals with an intellectual disability to acquire metacognitive strategies. This enabled them to generalize the learning experience and become self-regulated and better problem solvers. Also, using a computer program promoted the use of metacognitive strategies. Once students internalize target strategies, they can transfer these to second language patterns; therefore, it enhances the generalization of learning individuals with an intellectual disability. Recommendations for further research were discussed.";2016;01-01;World Journal on Educational Technology: Current Issues;8;3;277-293;;;;#29014;Jalloul 2016;

The effects of peer to peer mand training on unprompted mand frequency for children with autism and intellectual/ developmental disabilities;Kittenbrink, Rachel L.;Students with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), by nature of diagnosis, demonstrate qualitative differences in communication and social interaction. Current post-secondary outcomes for individuals with autism highlight the need for intensive interventions to prepare students for improved quality of life, access to employment, and post-secondary education options. The inability to communicate one's wants and needs effectively to adults and peers significantly limits the likelihood for independent successful navigation of one's community and of the larger society. Interventions grounded in applied behavior analysis and designed to teach requesting or manding behaviors to individuals with autism and intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDD) are strongly supported in the literature. The wealth of current research in this area focuses strongly on teaching requesting behaviors from children with autism or IDD to adults. As individuals with autism and IDD age, the need to communicate wants and needs to peers, as well as to develop social skills continues to grow. The current study used a peer manding treatment package, embedding the use of differential reinforcement, controls for motivation, and time delay procedures to assess the effects on peer manding and reinforcer delivery rates in elementary school students with autism and IDD. A multiple probe across dyads design (Horner & Baer, 1978) was used to evaluate effectiveness of the peer manding treatment package on unprompted peer mands and unprompted reinforcer deliveries during 12 min mand sessions. All participants were active in the baseline, intervention, withdrawal, generalization, and maintenance phases of the investigation. All participants demonstrated increased unprompted mands and unprompted reinforcer deliveries following exposure to the treatment package, demonstrating a functional relation between the treatment package and increased response levels. Participants' response levels in the phases following the intervention phase were more variable, but as a whole, response levels maintained throughout the investigation. Considerations for interpreting the results are included and recommendations for future research and practitioners are discussed.

Effects of money simulation application on persons with intellectual disabilities with money transaction difficulties;"Lee, E.; Kwon, J.";The ultimate purpose of educating students with disabilities is to help them acquire the ability to live independently within the community in adulthood. Money transaction skills are critical when making purchases and are essential to living independently. In this study, we used an A-B-A-B single-subject experimental design to measure the effects of a simulation application using smart phones on the acquisition of purchasing skills among students with intellectual disabilities, particularly with making monetary payments. Four participants who had previously not been able to independently make such payments were briefly trained to use the application. The results suggested that utilising the application enhanced participants' monetary skills when making purchases. Success relied on being able to look at the application and match the visuals with real money, rather than on participants' levels of academic preparedness. Furthermore, using the relatively discrete tool minimised the social stigma associated with difficulty performing money transactions successfully.

Effects of Peer-Mediated Instruction on Mathematical Problem Solving for Students with Moderate/Severe Intellectual Disability;Ley Davis, Luann;"The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2006) set a precedent that established even higher expectations for all students, including those with disabilities. More recently, the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers developed a common set of state standards for proficiency in English language arts and mathematics known as the Common Core State Standards (CCSS, 2010). The CCSS in mathematics define and detail the content expectations and standards for mathematical practices for grades K-12. Their intent is to provide a rigorous, focused, and structured set of standards to prepare students in the 21st century to be college and career ready upon exiting the high school system. To meet these increased expectations, this investigation sought to determine the effects of peer-mediated schema based instruction on the number of correct steps of a task analysis to solve the ""change"" problem type of mathematical word problems with middle school students with moderate/severe intellectual disabilities (MS/ID). Additionally, this study investigated the effects of peer-mediated schema based instruction on the number of correct mathematical problems solved, the ability of students with MS/ID to discriminate between addition and subtraction in word problems for the ""change"" problem type, and if students with MS/ID were able to generalize the learned mathematical skills to an unfamiliar peer. Finally, this study examined the effects of peer-mediated instruction on both tutors' and tutees' social attitudes and perceptions of one another before and after the study was completed. The findings of this study demonstrated a functional relation between peer-mediated schema-based instruction (SBI) on the number of correct steps of a task analysis. Results also provided several implications for practice, offers suggestions for future research in this area, and discusses the social and academic benefits of using peer-mediated instruction for students with MS/ID.

Effectiveness of multimedia education program on the development of self-help and life skills in educable, mentally retarded students;"Mosavi, F.; Abazari, Z.; Beigipoor, F.; Asadi, N.";Objectives: Multimedia messages are designed considering how the human brain functions as opposed to other forms of media that are not planned accordingly. They are likely to lead to more effective and meaningful learning. In the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, it is assumed, firstly, that the human information processing system has two separate channels for processing: visual and auditory. Methods: This research is an applied one in terms of objective. A pretest and posttest, with a control group, research design for the collection of data also makes it a quasi-experimental one. The statistical population included all educable, mentally retarded students in grades two and three of elementary schools in Qasr-e Shirin in the academic year 2014-2015. Twelve students were selected through accessible sampling method and were randomly assigned into control and experimental groups. Results: The results showed that the implementation of multimedia training is effective in the development of self-help and life skills of educable, mentally retarded students. Discussion: The findings indicated that multimedia education can be used to develop self-help and life skills along with traditional methods.;2016;;Iranian Rehabilitation Journal;14;3;179-184;;10.18869/nrip.irj.14.3.179;;#12505;Mosavi 2016;
The Effectiveness of a Multi Sensory Approach in Improving Letter-Sound Correspondence among Mild Intellectual Disabled Students in State of Kuwait;"Moustafa, Amr; Ghani, Mohd Zuri";This research examines the effectiveness of multi sensory approach for the purpose of improving the knowledge on English Letter sound correspondence among mild disabled students in the state of Kuwait. The discussion in this study is based on the multisensory approach that could be applied in the teaching of reading skills as well as phonemic awareness skills which could enable the students to acquire the early skills of reading. A total of 20 respondents were involved in the process of gathering data through the quantitative study method, which compromises of male and female mild intellectual disabled students. A pretest-postest method was applied in order to examine the effectiveness of the multisensory approach that could make it possible for them to identify the letters and its sounds. T test for the paired sample was used to figure out the significant differences between the pretest and posttest scores achieved by the students. The findings of the study showed the effect of the multi sensory approach in the teaching process of identifying the English letters and its sounds, which at the same time pave a way for the students to apply the mentioned skills in their learning process to read. This study is also significant for schools, centres, and institutes that are involved in the field of special education. Finally, it is considered as a road map to enable the students to learn and acquire the early skills of reading.;2016;01-01;Journal of Education and Practice;7;32;151-156;;;;#28011;Moustafa 2016;
A Novel Enuresis Alarm for Toilet Training Students With Intellectual Disability: An Initial Evaluation in a School Setting;"Mruzek, D.W.; McAleavey, S.; Engel, S.; Smith, T.";"In this study, a novel enuresis alarm device using a miniaturized radio frequency module and disposable sensors made with inexpensive conductive ink was used to teach toilet use for urination with three participants with severe intellectual disability (two males and one female; aged 7–15 years) in a private special education school setting. At study entry, the participants did not use the toilet for urination independently, despite prior training attempts using standard behavioral interventions. For each participant, the enuresis alarm was used as part of a manualized behavior modification program. Two of the participants progressed markedly in the acquisition of toileting skills during participation in the program, but results for the third participant were less clear. Data suggest high staff satisfaction with the device and procedure and several possible advantages over standard behavioral intervention. Thus, an enuresis alarm that comprises state-of-the-art technology may be useful for teaching toileting skills in classroom settings for some individuals with developmental disabilities. © The Author(s) 2016.";2016;;Journal of Special Education Technology;31;4;217-227;;10.1177/0162643416673915;;#12169;Mruzek 2016;

Identifying interventions for improving letter formation: A brief experimental analysis of students with intellectual disabilities;"Özmen, E.R.; Atbaşi, Z.";"As a group, students with intellectual disabilities display difficulties in a wide range of academic skills, including the acquisition of basic academic skills such as literacy. Early writing and reading skills must be supported to prepare students with intellectual disabilities to learn to read and write. The goal of this study was to replicate and extend the current research on Brief Experimental Analysis with letter formation. Three students with intellectual disabilities participated in the study. A brief multi-element design was used to test effectiveness of four interventions on letter formation. These interventions included goal setting plus contingent reinforcement, graphical feedback, error correction and modeling. For one student, modeling was effective; for the two remaining students, goal setting plus contingent reinforcement was effective. The results of this study extend the BEA literature by investigating the effects of interventions for improving letter formation in students with intellectual disabilities.

Effects of Modified Schema-Based Instruction on Real-World Algebra Problem Solving of Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Moderate Intellectual Disability;Root, Jenny Rose;The current study evaluated the effects of modified schema-based instruction (SBI) on the algebra problem solving skills of three middle school students with autism spectrum disorder and moderate intellectual disability (ASD/ID). Participants learned to solve two types of group word problems: missing-whole and missing-part. The themes of the word problems were related to their interests and daily experiences. In addition, participants were taught key mathematics vocabulary terms using constant time delay. Participants were taught how to use an iPad that displayed a task analysis with embedded verbal and specific verbal prompts to complete each step of solving the real-world algebra word problems. This study also examined participant's ability to generalize skills when stimulus supports were faded. Results showed a functional relation between constant time delay and acquisition of mathematics vocabulary terms as well as between modified SBI and mathematical problem solving. Participants were able to successfully solve both types of group problems and had some success with generalizing skills when stimulus supports were faded. The findings of this study provide several implications for practice for using modified SBI to teach mathematical problem solving to students with ASD/ID, and offer suggestions for future research in this area.

Enhancing academic performance of three boys with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities through a computer-based program;"Stasolla, F.; Perilli, V.; Boccasini, A.; Caffò, A.O.; Damiani, R.; Albano, V.";We assessed a computer-based rehabilitative program (i.e., tablet device with touch screen and adapted software) to improve academic performance and to increase the on-task behavior of three children with autism spectrum disorders and mild intellectual disabilities in a school setting. Furthermore, the study pursued the following objectives: (a) monitor its effects on the generalization process, occurring two months after the end of the intervention, within home context, (b) reduce repetitive (stereotypic) behaviors exhibited by the participants (i.e., hand clapping, washing and voice noises), and (c) carry out a social validation assessment involving 48 support teachers (i.e., professionals who follow children with developmental disabilities with a special and individualized training program within a school context) as external raters. The study was conducted according to a changing criterion design for each participant. Results showed an improvement in performance (i.e.,academic activities correctly achieved and percentage of intervals with on-task behavior), for all participants recruited, that they generalized once the program was implemented within their homes. Moreover, all children showed a reduction of repetitive behaviors during intervention phases compared to baseline. Finally, external raters (i.e., support teachers) considered the use of the technology favorably. Educational, practical and psychological implications of the findings were discussed. © 2016 Associazione Oasi Maria SS.;2016;;Life Span and Disability;19;2;153-183;;;;#12542;Stasolla 2016;
Using the Choiceboard Creator™ app on an iPad© to teach choice making to a student with severe disabilities;Stephenson, J.;This paper describes an intervention to teach the use of the Choiceboard Creator app on an iPad for choice making to a student with autism, severe intellectual disability, and challenging behavior. This app provides flexibility in the number of pictures and blank distractors displayed, produces voice output, shuffles the picture arrangement after each activation, and makes the selected picture more salient by enlarging it once it has been selected. The effectiveness of the intervention was explored using a multiple baseline across three settings. Pre-and post-assessments of the students ability to select a picture given the spoken word or the object and to select the object given the spoken word or the picture explored the further development of picture skills. The student learned to use a display of three pictures in free play, a display of two pictures in morning circle, and a display of five pictures at morning tea. © 2016 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.;2016;;AAC: Augmentative and Alternative Communication;32;1;49-57;;10.3109/07434618.2015.1136688;;#12492;Stephenson 2016;

Improving the comprehension of students with significant developmental disabilities: Systematic instruction on the steps for completing and using a graphic organizer;Britt, Alexander P.;"A single-subject, multiple-baseline across participants design was used to examine the functional relation between systematic instruction and the ability to complete a graphic organizer and recall facts about informational texts by students with significant development disabilities. Four high school students enrolled in an adapted academic program for individuals with intellectual disabilities participated in this study. Systematic instruction procedures included four separate trainings: (a) direct instruction on seven story-grammar concepts for social studies content, (b) guided practice on the steps for completing the graphic organizer using a modified system of least prompts, (c) guided practice on the steps for using the graphic organizer to answer comprehension questions using verbal and verbal-gestural prompts, and (d) independent practice with feedback using verbal and verbal-gestural prompts. Data were collected on three dependent variables: (a) task completion; (b) total independent story-statements; and (c) total guided story-statements, with and without materials displayed. The results of this study demonstrated strong evidence of a functional relation between systematic instruction and students' performances on the task completion and total guided story-statements, with and without materials displayed, measures. However, there was no evidence of a function relation between systematic instruction and total independent story-statements. Data collected in the generalization indicated all four students continued to perform at or near the improved level on the task completion and total guided story-statements measures after accessing texts that followed novel structures. Therefore, the findings of the current study suggest students with significant developmental disabilities were able to complete the graphic organizer in order to summarize an informational text. These results also indicate these same students were able to answer questions about texts with and without materials displayed after completing the graphic organizer. Study practical implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

Effects of online module + ecoaching on comprehension instruction for students with significant intellectual disability;Cheek, Aftynne Elizabeth;"Comprehension is a vital part of learning to read (Copeland, 2007); however, research on comprehension instruction for students with SID is limited (e.g., Browder, Wakeman, Spooner, Ahlgrim-Delzell, & Algozzine, 2006), and there is no clear evidence-based practice for teaching comprehension to students with SID. Teachers may acquire knowledge of comprehension instruction through professional development, but often struggle translating learned knowledge into practice (Rock, Zigmond, Gregg, & Gable, 2011). One way to facilitate teachers' transfer is through eCoaching. Therefore, purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of job-embedded professional development (i.e., online module + eCoaching) on teachers as they provided comprehension instruction to students with SID. The researcher used a single subject, multiple-baseline across participants' design (Gast, 2010) to investigate the effects of an online module plus eCoaching on teachers' use of the CAR and CROWD during shared reading for students with SID and the impact on students' listening comprehension. Three Teacher Participants and three Student Participants participated in this study. The setting was a separate school in the Southeast. Dependent variables included teacher opportunities to respond (OTR), frequency and variety of teacher questioning with the CROWD strategy, student engagement, and student independent correct responses to listening comprehension questions. Results indicated the online module plus eCoaching was effective in increasing teacher OTR, questioning, and independent correct responses; and confirmed the efficacy of an online module plus eCoaching as effective way to support teachers as they begin to provide comprehension instruction to students with SID. Limitations, implications, and future directions are discussed.

Using Read-Alouds of Grade-Level Social Studies Text and Systematic Prompting to Promote Comprehension for Students with Severe Disabilities;"Courtade, G.R.; Gurney, B.N.; Carden, R.";Learning social studies content is important for all students, including those with severe disabilities. However, there is a limited amount of research that specifically examines teaching social studies to this population of students. Therefore, educators must look to research-based practices in other academic areas (e.g., English language arts) to determine new strategies to teach this important content. Using a multiple probe across participants design, three fifth-grade students with severe disabilities were taught to answer comprehension questions during read-alouds of social studies text using a modified system of least prompts and graphic organizer. Findings indicate all students improved on the correct number of comprehension questions answered independently. Implications for practice and ideas for future research to teach social studies to students with severe disabilities are discussed. © 2017;2017;;Journal of Social Studies Research;41;4;291-301;;10.1016/j.jssr.2017.05.002;;#11758;Courtade 2017;

Evaluating the effects of formal corrective feedback on off-task/on-task behavior of mild intellectually disabled students: An action research study;George, Kevin;"The off-task behavior demonstrated by the study participants appears to interfere with classroom instruction, contribute to poor academic performance and in many instances lead to disciplinary actions such as suspension. The purpose of the study entailed determining if formal corrective feedback has an effect on the off-task/on-task behavior of mild intellectually disabled students. Research questions were aimed at determining if formal corrective feedback effects the off-task behavior as well as whether it effects the on-task behavior of the study participants. A mixed research methodology was used to structure the study in order to ensure that a detailed picture be constructed of the small group of participants. The theories of constructivism, behaviorism were essential to the choice of treatment applied as well as to the method used to quantify behavior. The Direct Behavior Rating form (DBR) was used to rate the off-task/on-task behavior of each student and frequency behavior recordings of the various forms of off-task behavior demonstrated by each student was completed as well. The goal of the study looked to identify a potential strategy for addressing the behavioral deficiencies commonly displayed by students classified as mild intellectually disabled as well as any other student determined to have behavioral issues within the classroom setting. The study's results revealed that formal corrective feedback had a significant effect on the off-task/on-task behavior of students classified as being mild intellectually disabled. Additionally, it was found that formal corrective feedback had a relatively strong effect on all specific forms of off-task behaviors except ""work refusal"". A major implication of this study is that perhaps it would be best practice to focus on establishing and teaching an on-task behavior curriculum in addition to the academic curriculum already being taught to students classified as being mild intellectually disabled.

Factors affecting dance exercise performance in students at a special needs school;"Ito, Y.; Hiramoto, I.; Kodama, H.";Background: In Japan, dance exercise has been introduced as a compulsory element of health and physical education, but there is a considerable discrepancy in the levels of performance among students with intellectual disability (ID) at special needs schools. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the factors affecting the performance of dance exercise in students with ID. Methods: A 4 month dance exercise program was implemented for junior high school students at a special needs school, and the performance of 32 students at 22 sessions was assessed quantitatively according to calorie use during exercise and performance proficiency score. The measures were compared according to gender, age, body mass index, diagnosis, and development quotient (DQ) score. Results: Performance in many students improved with repetition and reached the highest attainment level at around the third month. Male gender and older age had a significant positive impact on calorie use, whereas diagnosis of Down syndrome and higher DQ score had a significant positive impact on proficiency score. Four students with poor performance were all female students with autism. Conclusion: This study provides some possible explanations for differences in the levels of dance performance among students with ID. © 2017 Japan Pediatric Society;2017;;Pediatrics International;59;9;967-972;;10.1111/ped.13338;;#11773;Ito 2017;original_search
Examining the effects of the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction on students with and without intellectual disability;Jenkins-Cook, Toni;This dissertation is composed of four chapters linked by the use of the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI), a model of teaching to promote self-regulated goal setting and attainment. Chapter One provides an overview of self-determination, including component elements, essential characteristics, and anticipated outcomes from interventions that promote self-determination. A review of literature associated with student-directed learning strategies, the SDLMI, promoting the self-determination of students with extensive support needs, and promoting the self-determination of elementary-aged students without disability is also included in Chapter One. Chapter Two reports a study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the SDLMI when used with elementary school students who have extensive support needs. Chapter Three describes a study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the SDLMI when used with elementary students without disabilities. Finally, Chapter Four summarizes the previous chapters and draws conclusions and implications for future research and practice for elementary school students with and without disability.

Effects of GO 4 IT . . . NOW! Strategy Instruction on Expository Writing Skills for Students with Disabilities;"Konrad, Moira; Clark, Kelly A.; Test, David W.";Students with disabilities trail behind their peers without disabilities while in school, as well as in post-secondary outcome areas. Given that self-determination and enhanced academic skills are associated with improved post-school outcomes, one possible solution is to identify interventions that teach self-determination and academic skills simultaneously. This study investigated the effects of GO 4 IT . . . NOW! strategy instruction on expository writing skills of five high school students with low-incidence disabilities. Using a multiple-probe-across-participants design, the authors measured the effects of strategy instruction on quality of expository paragraphs and quality and content of individualized education program (IEP) goal paragraphs. Results indicated a functional relation between the intervention and improved paragraph writing.

The instructional thematic game for children with mild mental retardation: For enhancement of left-right recognition skill;"Kuswardhana, D.; Hasegawa, S.; Juhanaini";Children with mild mental retardation had several difficulties with interaction, remembering information, problem-solving, physic-motoric, learning problem, etc. Therefore, we proposed a novel framework to increase their learning skill using instructional thematic game rehabilitation framework based on Kinect sensor as the solution. Basically, the framework had three components. First, intellectual functions, which implied to the competencies reached through the game by the student. Second, instructional thematic game model, which was the concept to learn everything from the real single topic of the subject by associating to the abstract objects. Three, computer sensor device, which was the equipment as the bridge between the children and the program application. This research covered enhancement of right and left-hand recognition. We adopted Single Subject Research to evaluate the effectiveness of the system and to explore each of the individual.s progress. This process was divided into 2 steps. Namely, baseline stage and treatment stage. Apparently, from our finding, such framework gave the student an enhanced learning skill covering left-right recognition skill, decreasing the level of disturbance, and improving the level of learning independence.

Literacy Instruction for Learners with Moderate to Severe Intellectual Disabilities: A Chance for Growth in Reading through Adapted Materials and Evidence-Based Strategies;Molina, Leslie;The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adapted materials paired with evidence-based strategies during literacy instruction for high school students with moderate to severe disabilities. Historically, students with severe disabilities have been denied consistent and quality literacy instruction in the educational setting. If reading instruction was provided, it traditionally centered on sight words used throughout a student's daily life (Browder Ahlgrim-Delzell, Spooner, Mims, & Baker, 2009). No Child Left Behind (NCLB) (2002) and the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (2004) mandated that students with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities participate in school accountability through large-scale assessments for annual yearly progress (AYP). Those alternate assessments no longer target daily living skills and functional activities, but instead focus intensely on academic alternate state standards, aligned with the general education state standards/Common Core State Standards for core subjects (English Language Arts and math) that are assessed at designated grade levels (Mims, Hudson, & Browder, 2012). This study focuses on literacy instruction using adapted materials that incorporate photo/line drawing support delivered through systematic instruction to enhance the literacy skills of high school aged students with moderate to severe disabilities.

Effects of Using Simultaneous Prompting and Computer-Assisted Instruction During Small Group Instruction.;"Ozen, Arzu; Ergenekon, Yasemin; Ulke-Kurkcuoglu, Burcu";The current study investigated the relation between simultaneous prompting (SP), computer-assisted instruction (CAI), and the receptive identification of target pictures (presented on laptop computer) for four preschool students with developmental disabilities. The students’ acquisition of nontarget information through observational learning also was examined. A multiple probe design across target skills was used to evaluate the intervention. The students learned to receptively identify pictures of household items when SP and CAI were used together in small group instructional sessions. In addition, students maintained and generalized behaviors across adult implementers. Furthermore, students learned nontarget information. Finally, the social validity of the intervention was assessed by graduate students and all viewed the procedures positively.

Examining the Effectiveness of Direct Instruction on the Acquisition of Social Skills of Mentally Retarded Students in Regular Classroom Settings;"Özokcu, Osman; Akçamete, Gönül; Özyürek, Mehmet";The purpose of this study is to reveal whether or not the social skills teaching program based on the direct instruction approach is effective on the ability of mentally retarded students in regular classroom settings to gain social skills such as apologizing, asking for help and finishing a task on time, and to generalize these abilities. This study used the model of multiple-probe design between subjects which takes place in the research methods of single-subject design. The researchers carried out this study with one 12-year-old male student and two female students, ages 12 and 11. To collect study data, this study used the teacher interview form, the social skills checklist, criterion-referenced measurement tools and data record tables. Graphical analyses were used to analyze data. To use target social skills (skills of apologizing, asking for help and finishing a task on time) in education, instructional plans that included acting as a model, guided practice and independent practice steps, which are the basic stages of the direct instruction approach, were prepared. In the social skills program, teaching sessions were held separately and conducted 3 days per week. At the end of the teaching sessions, generalization sessions took place. After this study, it was seen that the social skills teaching program based on the direct instruction approach was effective on the ability of three mentally retarded students to gain the target social skills and to generalize these abilities.;2017;04-01;Journal of Education and Training Studies;5;4;214-226;;;;#29279;Özokcu 2017;

Promoting Joint Attention in Children with Visual Impairment: Proposing an Intervention Using Modified Strategies from Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement Regulation (JASPER);Ross, Mary Christine;"Joint attention is developmental skill that is typically acquired through visual input during the first year of life in typically developing children. Children with visual impairments develop joint attention through alternate senses such as tactile and auditory input (Baron-Cohen, 1995) and show joint attention behaviors unlike those of typically developing children (Herrera, 2015). Both factors can lead to delayed or disorder joint attention in children with visual impairments. Children with visual impairments and additional disabilities are at higher risk for disorders of joint attention due to co-occurring disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities, which compound the difficulty in developing joint attention. There are no known interventions to address disorders of joint attention in children with visual impairments and additional disabilities. This study used a multiple baseline single subject research design to determine if modified strategies from Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement Regulation (JASPER; Kasari, Freeman, Paparella 2006), are an effective joint attention intervention for children with visual impairment and additional disabilities. Four subjects with varied levels of visual impairment and additional disabilities participated in the intervention over 15-weeks, 2-3 time per week for 20-30 minutes, within a school setting. All subjects showed improvement in the level and the duration of time spent in joint attention engagement. Results suggest that modified strategies from JASPER are an effective intervention for facilitating joint attention in children with visual impairments and additional disabilities.

Tele-health training of teachers to teach a mindfulness-based procedure for selfmanagement of aggressive behavior to students with intellectual and developmental disabilities;"Singh, N.N.; Chan, J.; Karazsia, B.T.; McPherson, C.L.; Jackman, M.M.";Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using tele-health technology to teach three teachers in a rural school district the basics of a mindfulness-based procedure, measure the fidelity of the teachers teaching the procedure to a student in their class, and to assess the effectiveness of the students’ use of the procedure, in terms of their physical and verbal aggression. Methods: A multiple-baseline design across participants was used, with a 12-month follow-up. Tele-health technology was used to teach teachers meditation on the Soles of the Feet (SoF) procedure. The students were able to use the procedure to downregulate their emotions associated with the earliest precursors to verbal and physical aggression. We measured the fidelity of the teachers’ and the students’ SoF training, as well as behavioral outcomes for the students in terms of frequency of physical and verbal aggression. Results: The tele-health technology was used successfully to teach the teachers how to personally use and then teach the SoF procedure to their students in a face-to-face school setting. The fidelity of teacher and student training in the SoF procedure was high. The students were able to learn how to downregulate their emotional reactions to rising anger and aggression, thereby reducing physical aggression to near-zero levels and verbal aggression to close to zero levels in the follow-up period. Conclusions: Tele-health may be an effective approach to providing training and therapy to caregivers in remote locations that cannot readily access specialist services. © The British Society of Developmental Disabilities 2017.;2017;;International Journal of Developmental Disabilities;63;4;195-203;;10.1080/20473869.2016.1277841;;#12069;Singh 2017;

The instructional package includes a blend of research-based instructional practices including explicit instruction, the CRA sequence, and Dynamic Geometry Software. A multiple probe design across four participants was used to evaluate the intervention. The participants were four students with a history of mathematics difficulty in a suburban mid-Atlantic high school. Results of the study demonstrated that all four students improved their accuracy on geometric similarity transformations and maintained those skills four weeks after the completion of the intervention. Furthermore, providing multiple visual representations, including technology such as dynamic geometry software, as well as concrete manipulatives, allowed participants to make connections to geometric content and enhanced their metacognition, self-efficacy, and disposition toward geometry. This study supports the use of integrated instruction utilizing explicit instruction and visual representations for high school students with MD on grade-level geometry content.

The effectiveness of painting therapy program for the treatment of externalizing behaviors in children with intellectual disability;"Beh-Pajooh, Ahmad; Abdollahi, Abbas; Hosseinian, Simin";"Externalizing behaviors are prevalent among children with intellectual disability (ID). This study was conducted to identify the effectiveness of painting therapy program in alleviating the externalizing behaviors of male children with ID. In a randomized clinical trial, 60 children with ID were separated into intervention group and control group. The intervention group received the painting therapy program (12 weeks; two sessions per week), while the control group did not receive any program. The questionnaires were completed by their parents in order to evaluate the externalizing behaviors of children at the beginning and at the end of the painting therapy program. A two-way repeated-measure Analysis of Variance showed that the mean levels of externalizing behaviors in the intervention group decreased after the painting therapy program. In addition, the analysis showed that the mean levels of externalizing behaviors between the intervention group and the control group were significantly different. The findings revealed that painting therapy program could alleviate the externalizing behaviors of children with ID.

Effects of a multi-component intervention package on academic skills for students with severe disabilities;Brosh, Chelsi Rose;The current study evaluated the effects of a multi-component intervention package (modified schema-based instruction (MSBI) with systematic feedback in the consequent event) on mathematical problem-solving and embedded non-targeted science and English language arts (ELA) comprehension for three elementary students with moderate and severe intellectual disability (ID). Using systematic instruction with a system of least prompts, a task analysis and a graphic organizer with manipulatives, participants learned to solve group word problems: using addition to solve for the part-part-whole relationship. In addition to learning how to solve addition word problems, participants were also taught grade-aligned science and ELA concepts using non-targeted information (NTI) presented as instructive feedback in the consequent event. Generalization of mathematical problem-solving to a digital presentation using an iPad was also measured. In addition, this study also examined participant's ability to generalize mathematical problem-solving skills when stimulus supports (i.e., task analysis and graphic organizer) were faded from the instructional package. Results showed a functional relation between MSBI and mathematical problem-solving and between embedded NTI as systematic feedback in the consequent event and science and ELA knowledge. The findings of this study provide several implications for practice for using multi-component intervention packages to teach academic skills (MSBI to teach mathematical problem-solving while simultaneously presenting NTI as systematic feedback to teach discrete academic skills) to students with moderate and severe ID. Limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Use of Visual Supports to Increase Task Independence in Students with Severe Disabilities in Inclusive Educational Settings;"Cohen, Annamarie; Demchak, MaryAnn";The present study sought to determine if systematically teaching the use of visual supports to three students identified as having moderate to severe disabilities resulted in improved task completion and independence in general education settings. For each participant, a visual support system delineated a multi-step task, which prior to the implementation of the intervention, required extensive prompting. A non-concurrent multiple baseline design across participants demonstrated that the use of visual supports paired with systematically teaching use of the visual support increased independent task completion for each student. Results, analyzed through visual analysis and calculating effect size through Tau-U, showed intervention of visual supports paired with systematic teaching of the supports was highly effective for the participants. Social validity data gathered after the completion of the study revealed that teachers and support staff viewed the visual support intervention as an effective strategy in aiding the participants' independent task completion.;2018;03-01;Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities;53;1;84-99;;;;#29423;Cohen 2018;

Effects of high-probability request sequences on compliance to low-probability requests for a high school student with an intellectual disability;Fisher, Larry Blaine;Using a reversal design, the current study evaluated the effects of the high-probability request sequence (HPRS) on the compliance to low-probability requests for a high school student with a moderate intellectual disability. The participant was given three simple discrete prompts to complete tasks with which she had a history of complying (i.e., high-p requests) immediately before given a prompt to engage in requests with she had a history of not complying (e.g., low-p requests). In addition, reinforcement in the form of social praise and attention was provided contingent on compliance with each high-p and low-p request. This study also examined whether the effects observed during each phase of the study would be generalized if conditions were replicated by the classroom special education teacher. In addition, a social validity questionnaire was completed by the participant's teacher. The results indicated that a functional relation exists between the implementation of the HPRS on both the increase of compliance with low-p requests and a decrease in the latency to respond to these requests. The findings also demonstrated that the participant engaged in similar levels of compliance when the intervention was implemented by either the investigator or the special education teacher. Limitations, recommendations for future research, and implications for practice are provided.

Visuospatial processing improvements in students with Down Syndrome through the autonomous use of technologies;"Herrero, L.; Theirs, C.I.; Ruiz-Iniesta, A.; González, A.; Sanchez, V.; Pérez-Nieto, M.A.";The main purpose of our study was to examine whether autonomous training through the use of technologies could be associated with improvements in selective attention, visuospatial short-term memory and visuospatial processing in students with Down Syndrome (DS). In addition, our study aimed to analyse how the improvements in selective attention and visuospatial short-term memory tasks could predict improvements in visuospatial processing. Twenty-six children and adolescents with DS who belong to specialized schools for ID participated in the study. Three different mobile applications, Bubbles (selective attention), Pairs and Learn (visuospatial short-term memory) and Tangram (visuospatial processing) developed by Smile and Learn were used during a three-month period by the students. The results showed significant improvements through training in both, Pairs and Learn and Tangram, whereas there was no significant improvement in Bubbles. The results also showed that Pairs and Learn performance could predict a 36% variance in Tangram one. Cognitive and educational implications of these results are discussed. © 2018 British Educational Research Association;2018;;British Journal of Educational Technology;;;;;10.1111/bjet.12665;;#15232;Herrero 2018;

Effect of an aerobic fitness programme intervention on the motor proficiency of children with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities in India;"Kalgotra, R.; Warwal, J.S.";Purpose: The study aimed to assess the effect of an Aerobic Fitness Programme intervention on children with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities in Jammu, India. Method: In a pre-test post-test control group design, 66 children with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities, who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were placed in control and experimental groups. A validated tool, the Test of Motor Proficiency, was used as a pre-test and post-test measure to assess the effect of the intervention. Results: The mean difference between the two groups of children with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities was significant. ANCOVA analysis indicated F (1,28) = 312.13, P =.00 in children with mild intellectual disabilities, and F (1,32) = 22.540, P =.00 in children with moderate intellectual disabilities. The intervention was effective in developing visual motor control, upper limb speed and dexterity, running speed and agility, balance, strength, and upper limb coordination. It was ineffective in improving bilateral coordination in both groups of children with intellectual disabilities. Conclusion: This intervention programme can be introduced into the daily curriculum of children with intellectual disabilities at special schools. It would be helpful in compensating for the lack of physical activity due to classroombased teaching. © 2019, Action for Disability Regional Rehabilitation Centre.

Teaching concepts with wearable technology: Learning internal body organs;"Kara, E.; Güleç, M.; Çağıltay, K.";In this study, a wearable smart cloth was designed and developed for children with intellectual disabilities (IDs) to help them learn name and position of internal body organs. In this regard, five plush organs (heart, lungs, stomach, liver and intestines) that can interact with a smart cloth were designed. Additionally, an application that provides animated characters, feedback, visual cues, and sounds and also interacts with the smart cloth by controlling the sensors on the smart cloth were developed and utilized during the implementation. Participants of the study were four students from a private Special Education School in Turkey. As a research methodology, a single-subject research method was employed and the data were collected via field notes and video recordings. Results of the study showed that students with IDs can use smart cloth and it can help them to learn names and positions of internal body organs. Moreover, animated character can get their attention and students with IDs can complete instructions on their own. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.;2018;;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);10907 LNCS;;542-550;;10.1007/978-3-319-92049-8_39;;#15240;Kara 2018;

Evaluating the effects of a point-of-view video prompt intervention on the completion of science experiments with an individual with autism spectrum disorder and an individual with intellectual disability;Matsik, Molly Anne;Students with disabilities are spending increasingly more time included in general education classes in public schools. One class students with disabilities are often included in is science. However, student with disabilities tend to require increased assistance from the teacher, a peer, or a paraprofessional to actively participate in the class. Very little research has been done to evaluate the effects of interventions that can be used to promote independence and encourage learning in inclusive science classes. The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of point-of-view video prompt intervention on the completion of science laboratory experiments with two individuals with disabilities. The results of the study indicated that when the participants received a more traditional, verbal delivery of the instructions, they required a higher degree of support from the instructor. However, when the intervention was in place the participants were able to complete the science experiments more independently and with less prompting from the instructor. Social validity was assessed at the conclusion of the study and both participants reported to like using the intervention to conduct science experiments.

An evaluation of delay to reinforcement and mand variability during functional communication training;"Muething, Colin S.; Falcomata, Terry S.; Ferguson, Raechal; Swinnea, Samantha; Shpall, Cayenne";Children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities often exhibit invariant responding (i.e., restricted behavioral repertoires), deficits in communication, and challenging behavior. Approaches demonstrated in the basic and applied literature to increase response variability include extinction, lag schedules of reinforcement, and percentile schedules of reinforcement. Results of basic studies have also indicated that delays to reinforcement often produce increases in response variability. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of a delay to reinforcement on the variability of communication responses during functional communication training with individuals with developmental disabilities and histories of engaging in challenging behavior. Results indicated that delays to reinforcement increased mand variability with all four participants with variable effects on challenging behavior across participants.;2018;2018-02-14;Journal of applied behavior analysis;51;2;263-275;;10.1002/jaba.441;;#44773;Muething 2018;systematic_review_manual

Effect of bibliotherapy on self-concept in children with mental retardation in SLB;"Nursalam, N.; Harsaktiningtyas, K.; Kurnia, I.D.; Fadhillah, H.; Efendi, F.";Introduction: Children with mental retardation are children with special needs with a level of intelligence > 70. The self-concept of a child with mental retardation is influenced by their pattern of care as well as their environment. Rejection by the environment and deviations in care adjustments can cause the child to be unwilling to communicate and interact, to form a bad perception of development and self-concept. Thus, the researchers were interested in studying the effect of bibliotherapy on the self-concept of children with mental retardation in SLB. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bibliotherapy had any influence on self-concept. Method: This study was a quasi-experimental research study which involved 42 respondents as its population. The population was made up of 24 students of SLB Sasanti Wiyata and 18 students of SLB AKW Kumara II Surabaya. The sample of this study was made up of 36 respondents according to the inclusion criteria, gathered using a purposive sampling technique. The independent variable was bibliotherapy. The dependent variable was self-concept. The instruments used were the Robson Self-Concept Questionnaires. The data analysis used a Manova test in SPSS with a significant value β < 0.05. Result: The results showed, in the treatment group via a Manova test, 0.005 for self-image, 0.033 for personal identity, 0.001 for self-esteem, 0.004 for self-ideal, 0.198 for role. With partial eta squared, the results indicated that bibliotherapy can affect self-esteem with a value of 0.302. The provision of bibliotherapy in this research was found to have a positive influence and improved self-concept in children with mental retardation in SLB. Discussion: Bibliotherapy can improve self-concept in children mental retardation in SLB. With bibliotherapy, children will learn and also imagine according to circumstances and desires. Moreover, one of the session in bibliotherapy encourage the children express their feelings. © 2018, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Contextualizing Mathematics: Teaching Problem Solving to Secondary Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities;"Root, Jenny R.; Hammons, Nannette; Saunders, Alicia F.; Gilley, Deidre";The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a multicomponent mathematics intervention (modified schema-based instruction, video anchors, and goal setting with self-graphing) on mathematical problem-solving skills of secondary students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Three participants were taught to solve percent of change word problems, which involved calculating the discounted price of an item or activity after using a coupon and then determining whether they had enough money to make the purchase. Results of the multiple probe across participant design indicate a functional relation between the intervention and problem solving, and all participants were able to generalize skills from word problems to real-world stimuli (i.e., coupons, receipts, menus). Implications for practice and future research are discussed.;2018;12-01;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities;56;6;442-457;;;;#29149;Root 2018;
Effectiveness of Constant Time Delay Instruction with Error Correction in Teaching the Skill of Identifying the Numerals to Students with Intellectual Disability;"Sahbaz, Ümit; Katlav, Selda";The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of constant time-delay instruction with error correction in teaching the skill of identifying the numerals (from 1 to 5) to students with light intellectual disability. The experimental design of this study was multiple-probe model with probe conditions across subjects which is one of the single-subject research models. While the dependent variable of the study was identifying the shown numerals on flash cards by subjects presented by researcher, the independent variable was constant time-delay method with error correction in the teaching of skill of telling the numerals. In this study, four students who have the diagnosis intellectual disability participated. One of the students took a place at the pilot implementation. The research process which was performed by the researcher was organized as instruction, probe, maintenance, generalization, and all sessions were proceed for all subjects as one-to-one instruction. It has been found that constant time-delay method with error correction was effective for the skill of identifying numerals by students with light intellectual disability. Additionally, it was seen that learned skill after the end of the instruction was maintained and generalized with different materials and conditions.;2018;01-01;European Journal of Special Education Research;3;1;111-132;;;;#30388;Sahbaz 2018;

Increasing Use of Research-Based Practices: Action Research Report on a College-School Partnership to Support Instruction Aligned to Middle School Common Core Math Standards for Students with Significant Disabilities;"Trela, Katherine; Gladstone-Brown, Wendy; Merritt, Norah; Raftis, Leah";Teachers of students with significant cognitive disabilities have expressed the need for additional training and resources to realign instruction to general education standards. At the same time, pre-service teachers preparing to enter the field of special education need to be placed in classrooms where teachers have updated knowledge and skills to deliver grade-aligned instruction to students in this population. In this project, the needs of both groups were addressed through a partnership between an Institute of Higher Education (IHE) and local board of cooperative education services. Specifically, in-service teachers received training in research-based practices to implement grade-aligned math instruction to middle school students with significant cognitive disabilities. Pre-service teachers who received the same training in their college coursework created adapted materials to implement the instruction. Results of the project's effect on in-service teachers, their students, and pre-service teachers are reported.

Efficacy of a Teacher Training a Paraprofessional to Promote Communication for a Student With Autism and Complex Communication Needs;"Wermer, L.; Brock, M.E.; Seaman, R.L.";Students with complex communication needs require well-designed supports to communicate effectively in school settings. Although paraprofessionals are often charged with supporting these students, they are rarely trained in how to promote communication, and there is limited research on how they might be trained. In this study, we used a multiple baseline across behaviors design to test the efficacy of a teacher-implemented training package to train a paraprofessional to provide opportunities for an elementary student with autism to respond, set up opportunities for her to initiate, and implement a systematic prompting hierarchy. We demonstrated a functional relation between the teacher-implemented training and paraprofessional acquisition of the strategies, and paraprofessional implementation coincided with increased student communication. This study replicates previous findings that paraprofessionals can be trained to implement evidence-based practices to promote use of alternative/augmentative communication, and extends this literature by demonstrating that a classroom teacher can deliver paraprofessional training effectively. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2017.;2018;;Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities;33;4;217-226;;10.1177/1088357617736052;;#14818;Wermer 2018;original_search
The Effects of Social Stories and a Token Economy on Decreasing Inappropriate Peer Interactions with a Middle School Student;"White, J.; Caniglia, C.; McLaughlin, T.F.; Bianco, L.";One of the many challenges that children with learning disabilities (LD) experience, apart from academics, is severe deficits in the areas of social skills and peer relations. The learning of social skills and appropriate ways to interact with peers are crucial for school-aged children with learning disabilities. Without these skills, it can be difficult for these children to maintain meaningful relationships as well as interact with peers in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to decrease inappropriate peer interactions in a middle school student with learning disabilities using simultaneous intervention delivery of social stories and a token economy. From previous studies, the use of social stories and token economies have both been shown to decrease inappropriate behaviors and increase appropriate behavior. Based on these studies, it was hypothesized that implementation of a token economy combined with social stories would be successful at decreasing inappropriate peer interactions. The participant was a 13-year-old boy with LD enrolled in a middle school in the Pacific Northwest. The researcher used a multiple baseline across settings design and implemented the two interventions simultaneously. The researcher found that the simultaneous use of social stories and a token economy was successful in decreasing inappropriate peer interactions in a middle school student with learning disabilities. © by LDW 2018.;2018;;Learning Disabilities;16;1;75-86;;;;#15168;White 2018;
Preview-view-review: Increasing academic access for students with intellectual disabilities who are English learners;Williamson, Dolores Marie;Recent changes to federal education laws for students with and without disabilities have kindled an increased interest in implementing evidence-based practices for teaching academic skills to all students, including students with severe disabilities and students learning English. Teaching students with significant disabilities who are learning English poses a unique set of challenges. To date, no research has been conducted on teaching science to students with significant intellectual disabilities who are learning English. This study was designed to measure the effect of an evidence-based science curriculum, delivered in both English and Spanish using the preview-view-review (PVR) strategy, on the science vocabulary and content knowledge acquired by students with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities who are learning English. This intervention was compared to the same research-based science curriculum delivered in English only. Using a parallel treatments design, both the English and PVR interventions were delivered concurrently via different, but equally challenging lessons on cells (English only) and precipitation (PVR). Results indicate that both the English-only and PVR interventions were effective in teaching science vocabulary words and pictures to English learners with ID. While the addition of Spanish in the PVR condition did not produce significantly higher outcomes than the English-only instruction, it also had no negative effects on student learning. Although there was no measurable difference in the amount of participation between the two conditions, there was a noticeable difference in the quality of discussion and participation in the PVR condition.

Developing conceptual understanding and procedural fluency in algebra for high school students with intellectual disability;Wojcik, Andrew J.;"Teaching students with Intellectual Disability (ID) is a relatively new endeavor. Beginning in 2001 with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, the general education curriculum integrated algebra across the K-12 curriculum (Kendall, 2011; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010), and expansion of the curriculum included five intertwined skills (productive disposition, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, and conceptual understanding) (Kilpatrick, Swafford, & Findell, 2001). Researchers are just beginning to explore the potential of students with ID with algebra (Browder, Spooner, Ahlgrim-Delzell, Harris & Wakeman, 2008; Creech-Galloway, Collins, Knight, & Bausch, 2013; Courtade, Spooner, Browder, & Jimenez, 2012; Goransson, Hellblom-Thibblin, & Axdorph, 2016). Most of the research examines the development of procedural fluency (Goransson et al., 2016) and few researchers have explored high school level skills. Using a single-case multiple-baseline across participants design, the study proposes to teach two algebra skills to six high school students with ID, creating an equation (y = mx + b) from a graph of a line and creating a graph from an equation. The six high school students with ID will be recruited from a school district in central Virginia. The intervention package modeled after Jimenez, Browder, and Courtade (2008), included modeling, templates, time delay prompting, and a task analysis. Results showed that all six individuals improved performance during intervention for the target skills over baseline; results also indicated that in three out of the six cases some generalization to the inverse skill occurred without supplemental intervention. The ability of individuals with ID to generalize the learning without intervention provides some evidence that individuals with ID are developing conceptual understanding while learning procedural fluency.

A school-based mentoring program developing healthy behaviors of adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities: A pilot feasibility study;"An, J.; DuBose, K.D.; Decker, J.T.; Hatala, L.E.";Background: Studies have reported that adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have a higher prevalence of obesity due to medication intake, poor diet, and physical inactivity. More importantly, they lack awareness and comprehension to prevent weight problems. Thereby, health-promoting practices should be offered in schools for adolescents with IDD. Objective/Hypothesis: This pilot study examined the feasibility of a school-based intervention using the I Can Do It! (ICDI) national health promotion model to promote healthy behaviors of adolescents with IDD. Methods: A pretest-posttest design was employed. Fourteen adolescents (9 males, 5 females) aged 12–15 years (mean = 13.4, SD = 0.9) from self-contained classrooms completed a 14-week intervention (60–70 min/session) over 4-month period. Healthy behaviors were evaluated by body composition (waist circumference and BMI z-score), physical activity level and nutrition behaviors. Results: Body composition did not change as a result of the intervention. The intervention increased the amount of time spent in physical activity, but not the frequency. In contrast, the children's water consumption did significantly increase after the intervention (d = 3.39). The amount of fruit and vegetables also significantly increased after the intervention, where only 7% reported eating these daily before the intervention and afterwards 86% reported eating fruits and vegetables daily (p < .0001). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that it is feasible to conduct a goal-driven, mentor-based intervention in school for adolescents with IDD. While preliminary effectiveness results are promising, future research should focus on rigorously testing the effectiveness of the ICDI model and examining the programs long-term sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;2019;;Disability and Health Journal;12;4;727-731;;10.1016/j.dhjo.2019.03.012;;#14290;An 2019;

Teaching students with significant cognitive disabilities to solve mathematical word problems: A mixed methods study;Bowman, Jessica Ashlee;Given the persistent focus of the field of special education on providing students with significant cognitive disabilities (SCD) access to the general education curriculum, very little research exists on how to provide this access within general education contexts. Many experts agree that true access to the general curriculum is multifaceted and includes access to general education contexts, teachers, peers, and activities. In addition, there is a lack of research on teaching students with SCD mathematical skills in ways that align with best practice according to mathematics education experts. To address these gap areas, this research study sought to combine mathematics instructional strategies from special education literature (i.e., the concrete-semiconcrete-abstract instructional sequence, explicit and systematic instruction, and embedded instruction) and reconcile it with some of the mathematical practices in the Common Core State Standards (e.g., making sense of problems and solving them, using mathematical models, communicating about their findings). This study used a mixed method design to investigate the impact of a multicomponent mathematics intervention on the mathematical word problem solving, strategy use, and concept acquisition of three elementary-aged students with SCD in general education classrooms. Findings of a single-case multiple probe design indicate that students learned to solve change type word problems using concrete and semiconcrete materials. However, the school year ended before students could master solving the word problems using abstract materials. According to qualitative data analysis all three students used both learned and invented strategies to successfully solve the word problems. Lastly, while addition and subtraction were taught simultaneously, all participants demonstrated acquisition of addition before subtraction. This research study demonstrates how embedded instruction can be used to provide students with SCD access to individualized mathematics instruction for a more complex mathematics skill while not interrupting their participation in the routines of the general education classroom. Findings also indicated several implications for practitioners as well as new areas for future research in the area of mathematics instruction for students with SCD.

Teaching Addition to Students with Moderate Disabilities Using Video Prompting;"Dueker, Scott A.; Cannella-Malone, Helen I.";"Academic performance for students with moderate to severe disabilities falls far behind their typically developing peers and puts them at risk for continued dependence after school ends. Video prompting is an evidence-based practice that has been used to teach various nonacademic skills; however, few studies have focused on using video prompting to teach academic skills other than reading. This study used a delayed multiple baseline across students design to evaluate the use of video prompting to teach single- and double-digit addition to three students with moderate disabilities. Results indicated that all three students improved their accurate completion of addition problems immediately upon introduction of the video prompting intervention. In addition, all three students completely faded the use of the videos and generalized completing addition problems to another setting. Social validity of the intervention was high across all participants, their families, and their teacher.";2019;09-01;Journal of Special Education Apprenticeship;8;2;1-20;;;;#29084;Dueker 2019;

A multiple probe design across behaviors was replicated across two students. Both students mastered iPhone navigation after observing a model and completing two to three sessions in a training phase. After training, students independently navigated the iPhone and played video prompts. Both students made substantial progress on all three tasks, reaching 100% accuracy in two of the tasks.

Preliminary investigation of the effects of a prelinguistic AAC intervention on social gaze behaviors from school-age children with multiple disabilities;Holyfield, C.;Some school-age children with multiple disabilities communicate predominately through the display of prelinguistic behaviors such as gestures, vocalizations, facial expressions, and eye gaze. Increasing the frequency and complexity of these behaviors may be one approach to building communication and transitioning toward linguistic communication (i.e., symbolic language). The current preliminary study used a single-subject ABB’B” design nested within a multiple baseline across participants design with randomization to evaluate a multi-phase intervention aimed at increasing social gaze behaviors. The participants were 5 school-age children with multiple disabilities. Participants appeared to demonstrate increases in both the frequency and complexity of their social gaze behavior during the intervention according to Improvement Rate Difference calculations that largely maintained four months after intervention ended. More research is needed, but the intervention shows promise as one aspect of AAC intervention for children who are prelinguistic communicators. Future research is critical to evaluating this or related interventions with a larger number of individuals and across a larger range of profiles and ages. © 2019, © 2019 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.;2019;;AAC: Augmentative and Alternative Communication;35;4;285-298;;10.1080/07434618.2019.1704866;;#14270;Holyfield 2019;

Teaching Social Skills in Small Groups of Children with Multiple Disabilities: Motor and Intellectual Disabilities. An Intervention Program;"Lappa, Christina; Mantzikos, Constantinos";Few studies have been conducted in Greece, which focus on the education of children with multiple disabilities (motor and intellectual disabilities, ID). Four children between the ages 9 and 15 with multiple disabilities (motor and ID) were selected to be taught social skills. The aim of this qualitative study was to provide training with regard to cognitive and communication skills and more specifically conversational skills to the four children in order to allow them to engage in conversational exchanges with their peers. Participants were evaluated for their mental capacity and assigned to two groups according to their ability. The intervention combined a table game (puzzle pairs), small-group teaching of structured questions with their answers, modeling, error correction, social praise and tangible reinforcement. A within-subject withdrawal design was used to show the acquisition of knowledge and of the ability to converse through conditions of baseline, teaching, probes and generalization measures. All participants learned to engage in structured conversations. This knowledge generalized and maintained to different settings after 3 and 7 months. A social validity measure affirmed these improvements in their ability to converse.;2019;01-01;European Journal of Special Education Research;4;1;57-77;;;;#30829;Lappa 2019;

Peer Tutoring to Support Inclusion of Students With the Most Significant Cognitive Disabilities at the Secondary Level.;"Malone, Kalley W.; Fodor, Julie A.; Hollingshead, Aleksandra";Inclusion of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities is a complex topic in special education. This study, conducted in a typical junior high school setting, examined the use of peer tutors to support three students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in a general education teen living classroom. Using a single-subject ABA design, researchers examined if the use of peer tutors would result in increased engagement and participation of students with cognitive disabilities. Researchers measured student engagement as writing, orienting to the instruction, talking to peers about the activity, raising hand to speak, or reading instructional materials. During instruction, target students were prompted through a visual checklist to ask their peer tutors questions or for help when needed. Results showed an increase in engagement during the intervention, which was maintained when peers withdrew prompting.

Training Verbal Working Memory in Children with Mild Intellectual Disabilities: Effects on Problem-solving.;"Orsolini, Margherita; Melogno, Sergio; Scalisi, Teresa Gloria; Latini, Nausica; Caira, Simona; Martini, Alessandro; Federico, Francesca";This multiple case study explores the effects of a cognitive training program in children with mild to borderline intellectual disability. Experimental training effects were evaluated comparing pre-/post-test changes of (a) a baseline phase versus a training phase in the same participant, (b) an experimental training versus either a no intervention phase or a control training in two pairs of children matched for cognitive profile. Key elements of the training program included (1) exercises and card games targeting inhibition, switching, and verbal working memory, (2) guided practice emphasizing concrete strategies to engage in exercises, and (3) a variable amount of adult support. The results show that both verbal working memory analyzed with the listening span test and problem-solving tested with the Raven's Matrices were significantly enhanced after the experimental training.

The acquisition of exercises in adolescents with severe intellectual disabilities.;"Page, E. Justin; Cannella-Malone, Helen I.";People with intellectual disabilities are at higher risk for obesity and associated disease and often do not engage in enough physical activity. By teaching people with intellectual disabilities how to engage in physical activity, there are numerous health benefits as well as the potential to increase their leisure activity repertoire. Previous literature has shown that evidence-based practices are needed to teach physical activities to people with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a prompting package to teach three adolescents with severe intellectual disabilities to engage in three different exercises. Three multiple probe across behaviour designs were used to demonstrate that the intervention was moderately successful. Future research is needed to find best practice techniques for teaching physical activity to people with severe intellectual disabilities.

Supporting Maintenance in Mathematics Using the Virtual-Representational-Abstract Instructional Sequence Intervention Package;Park, Jiyoon;Despite the growing attention being paid to teaching mathematics for students with disabilities, the existing research tends to focus on mathematical skill acquisition, but not on skill maintenance. Maintenance of mathematical skills is especially important as mathematics has applications in daily life and is directly related to important life skills such as purchasing, calculating tips, and budgeting. In addition, maintenance of basic mathematical skills is necessary for advancing to higher grade-level contents because mathematical contents build upon previous contents. This dissertation is comprised of three stand-alone but inter-related studies that explored the maintenance of mathematical skills among students with disabilities. The researcher conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding attention to maintenance when exploring mathematical interventions for students with intellectual disability and autism. The researcher then conducted two original studies, each which examined the effectiveness of an intervention package--the virtual-representational-abstract (VRA) instructional sequence with fading support and the VRA with overlearning--to promote maintenance of basic operations skills among students with disabilities. In the first study, to determine the extent to which researchers focused on skill maintenance in teaching mathematics, the researcher reviewed all studies from 1975 to 2018 that involved teaching mathematics to individuals with developmental disabilities. A total of 128 studies met inclusion criteria but only 46 studies involved a maintenance phase (35.9%). Of the studies that included a maintenance phase, there was no consensus among researchers on the standards for conducting a maintenance phase. The most widely taught mathematical content was numbers and operations. All studies employed intervention packages which included more than one instructional method and/or materials and the most widely used instructional method was prompting while the most widely used instructional materials were visual supports. The second study was an experimental research study which used a multiple probe across participants design to examine the effectiveness of the VRA instructional sequence with fading support in teaching subtraction with regrouping to four students with disabilities, including intellectual disability and/or autism. A functional relation was found between the VRA instructional sequence with fading support and students' accuracy in solving the problems. Students also maintained the skill up to six weeks after the intervention. The third study also utilized a multiple probe across participants design to evaluate the effectiveness of the VRA instructional sequence with overlearning in teaching multiplication to three students with disabilities. A functional relation existed between the VRA instructional sequence with overlearning and accuracy of solving multiplication problems. Students also maintained the skill up to eight weeks after the intervention. Overall, in this dissertation, intervention packages including more than one instructional, or a combination of instructional methods and materials were not only effective for skill acquisition, but also for skill maintenance. The review of literature identified explicit instruction with visual supports, manipulatives, or task analysis as potentially beneficial packages for promoting maintenance while the experimental studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the VRA instructional sequence with fading support or overlearning.

A Paragraph Text-Writing Intervention for Secondary Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities: A Single Case Design Study;Rodgers, Derek B.;"Written expression can be a critical skill for academic, vocational, and social pursuits. Unfortunately, research suggests that students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) struggle to develop writing skills. Paragraph text-writing is a component of written expression and refers to constructing multiple sentences about a singular topic with appropriate capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. The present study investigated the effects of a multicomponent intervention of explicit instruction and timed practice on the paragraph text-writing skills of four secondary student with IDD. The study included four dependent measures (paragraph text-writing rubric, total words written, and correct and incorrect writing sequences) and used a multiple-probe across participants design. Visual analysis and effect sizes revealed modest results. Three participants showed improvement on at least one of the dependent measures; one participant showed no improvement at all. The practical implications of this study are discussed within the context of existing writing literature, and the limitations are presented.

A video self-modeling intervention to modify aggressive behaviors in students with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities;Sadler, Kate Marie;This study evaluated the efficacy of a video self-modeling and functional behavior assessment intervention on a traditionally under-represented population. Students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) are prone to higher rates of aggressive behavior that can be resistant to treatment. Under the frameworks of Behaviorism and Social Cognitive Theory an intervention was developed to decrease aggressive behaviors and increase self-regulated behavior. A multiple baseline design across stimulus conditions with inter-subject replication was conducted to explore the effects of the intervention. Data was collected on both the rate of aggressive behaviors and the use of a replacement behavior which fostered socially appropriate self-regulation. The data indicate that both participants demonstrated a decrease in aggressive behavior immediately following intervention across all stimulus conditions. Data collected on the replacement behavior indicated a change from baseline to intervention but results differed across participants.

Effects of integrating augmented reality in early childhood special education;"Savitha, K.K.; Renumol, V.G.";Various research studies showed the praiseful impact of technology tools in the education process of the special kids. The intention of this comparative study was to explore how Augmented Reality (AR) based educational application would support mild and moderate Intellectually Disabled (ID) children of age 5-10. Eight ID students from a Block Resource Center in Kerala, India were participated in this study. They were divided into two groups. Children with hyperactivity were selected as experimental group, and they had extra support from AR-based tool via smartphone. The control group students were trained by using conventional method. After measuring the parameters such as learning outcome, response to the learning material, learning time and memory capacity, the data has been analyzed. From the analysis results, it noticed that the participants from the experimental group exhibited improvements in all the parame-ters than those in the control group. In addition to the experi-ment, a survey was conducted among their parents and the re-source teachers to know their feedback about the effectiveness of the application. The observed parameters and the survey results indicate that the implementation of AR-based educational ap-plications in early childhood special education system is worth to explore further. © BEIESP.;2019;;International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering;8;3;7864-7867;;10.35940/ijrte.C6552.098319;;#14306;Savitha 2019;
E-Books for Promoting Vocabulary Among Students With Intellectual Disability as Opposed to Children With Learning Disability: Can Repeated Reading Make a Difference?;"Shamir, Adina; Maor, Rotem";Despite young children's increasing access to electronic books (e-books) and the evidence indicating their effectiveness for promoting language and literacy, no study has yet explored the e-book's effect in this area among students with intellectual disability (ID). Motivated by this challenge, the current study sought to investigate the effect of an educational e-book on vocabulary acquisition among students with ID. The effect on vocabulary of five repeated readings of an e-book among students with ID was measured and compared with that of children with learning disability (LD). The findings indicate that whereas two independent rereadings with the e-book were enough to promote vocabulary acquisition among the students with LD, at least five rereadings were required to make a difference in the group with ID. Explanations and implications of the findings are discussed.

Quest technologies for corrective inclusive physical education service;"Vishnevsky, V.A.; Ukhvatova, I.A.; Malkov, M.N.";"The article analyzes benefits of a corrective inclusive physical education service model for the children with mental retardations that offers round trainings including sport labyrinths and quest technologies. The trainees’ physical and intellectual progress was rated by a special real-time software tool. Immediate responses of the trainees to the new training model were associated with: growths of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity; growths of the stress indices and heart rates; faster motor responses; sagging reactive anxiety rates; and the improved wellbeing rates. The tests also showed reduction of the total neurohumoral regulation level; energy-metabolic and humoral heart rate regulation channels; increased response range in the Response to Movement test; and the lower activity in the WAM test; with the responses being within the ranges of the trainees’ adaptation resources. The new corrective inclusive physical education service model was found beneficial as verified by the intellectual progress of the trainees in awareness, intuitive thinking, logical thinking, categorizing, abstract thinking, image synthesizing and the fast memorizing domains. © 2019, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

Video Prompting to Teach Robotics and Coding to Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder;Wright, John C.;Video-based modeling is an evidence-based practice for teaching social and communication skills, functional and daily living skills, and some academic skills to students with autism spectrum disorder. The efficacy of video-based modeling, however, has not yet been established for STEM skills related to science, technology, or engineering. Drawing on findings from a systematic review of video-based modeling to teach academic skills to students with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability, I used a single case study design to examine the efficacy of video-based modeling for teaching robotics and coding to students with autism spectrum disorder. Specifically, I used a multiple-probe across skills single case research design replicated across three middle school participants to teach block-based coding of robots. This afforded three intraparticipant replications and three interparticipant replications. Further, to substantiate the social and ecological validity of video-based modeling interventions for public school settings, a special education teacher implemented the intervention in a special education classroom during non-core instructional time. Additionally, questionnaires were disseminated to study participants and public school special educators naive to the study purpose and outcomes to assess the social validity (i.e., feasibility and effectiveness) of the intervention.

Self-Directed Video Prompting and Least-to-Most Prompting: Examining Ways of Increasing Vocational Skill Acquisition Among Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability;"Yakubova, G.; Leibowitz, L.; Baer, B.L.; Halawani, N.; Lestremau, L.";Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of point-of-view video prompting (VP) as a self-prompting strategy with a least-to-most prompting (LMP) system on the rapidity of skill acquisition of two students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and two students with intellectual disability (ID) when working on school-based vocational tasks. Methods: We used multiple probes across students design of single-case experimental methodology to examine whether or not causal relation existed between the intervention and students’ vocational skill acquisition and follow-up performance. Target tasks involved both process and basic functional mathematics steps that required students to pay attention to the process of task completion rather than the functional step itself. Results: All students showed immediate and considerable improvement in skill acquisition between baseline and intervention. Furthermore, all students completed the tasks with an average of over 90% accuracy once the LMP was removed. The four students in this study required two to six intervention trials to reach 100% accuracy without the use of LMP, with a mean of four trials. Tau-U effect size showed a strong effect of the intervention on skill acquisition and follow-up performance. Conclusions: VP and LMP as a combined intervention can be effective in teaching vocational tasks that involve process steps to students with both ASD and ID. VP can be a useful support for students with ASD and ID in school, community, and employment settings to decrease reliance on adult prompting and increase independence. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;2019;;Advances in Neurodevelopmental Disorders;3;3;246-258;;10.1007/s41252-019-0097-5;;#14295;Yakubova 2019;
Promoting transition planning among individuals with intellectual disability: Involving special educators;"Ahmad, Wasim; Thressiakutty, A. T.";The present study attempted to find out the effect of teachers’ training on developing transition planning among individuals with intellectual disability (IID) with respect to gender and age. Individuals with intellectual disability (N = 50) were intervened by the trained special educators. Single group pre and post test design has been used. Vocational Assessment and Programming System (VAPS) developed by Thressiakutty (1998) has been used in the present study. The data collected was analyzed using the statistical techniques such as t-test, ANCOVA and Post Hoc (LSD) Tukey test. The results show that the training has a remarkable impact on the development of transition planning among individuals with intellectual disability.

Evidence for a literacy intervention for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities;"Allor, Jill H.; Yovanoff, Paul; Al Otaiba, Stephanie; Ortiz, Miriam B.; Conner, Carlin";The importance of helping all children make meaningful progress in reading development is supported by legislative mandates and court rulings. The purpose of this research was to describe findings from a series of single-case design studies completed over three years to test the effects of a specific comprehensive literacy intervention, Friends on the Block, on word recognition. Participants were 18 students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) ranging in age from 6 to 13. Results were analyzed using Tau statistical procedures that indicate consistent moderate-to-strong positive effects across all participants for both sight words and decodable words. Across the 67 sight word studies the mean effect size was 0.73, and across the 8 decodable word studies the mean effect size was 0.74. Further research is needed to examine the impact of the intervention on a broader array of variables. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

Increasing Self-Evaluation Use through Video Feedback to Improve Academic Engagement among Students with Intellectual Disabilities;Aykut, Çigil;Self-evaluation is a skill that can help individuals to increase their own performance on completing tasks in engagements. The literature provides several examples of using self-evaluation with different participant groups with psychological and behavioral problems. There are a limited number of examples of using self-evaluation with individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs), which demonstrated effective use of self-evaluation combined with other techniques such as video feedback. The present study focused on examining the effectiveness of using video feedback to increase the use of self-evaluation of students with IDs who are trying to improve their academic engagement. The study applied a multiple probe design to track changes in the behaviors with three students with IDs. The study provided evidence that the students were able to improve their academic engagement in regard to increase on-task behaviors, raising hands, and compliance while increasing self-evaluation.;2020;01-01;International Journal of Progressive Education;16;1;111-124;;;;#31202;Aykut 2020;

Effects of modified schema-based instruction on addition and subtraction word problem solving of students with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability;Buncher, Amanda G.;According to the United States Department of Education, students diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) make up approximately 7.6% of students with disabilities in the U.S and are being educated within the general education classroom at an increasing rate, requiring educators to modify their current practices to meet the needs of this continually growing population. Impairments in executive functioning central coherence, metacognition, and attention often create barriers for students with ASD in regards to their academic achievement. Mathematics word problem solving is an area of academic concern for students with ASD, requiring planning and organization (executive functioning) and metacognitive monitoring skills which are often lacking in students with ASD. The majority of strategies for this population target computational skills and math fluency with very few addressing word problem solving. One promising intervention that has been used recently with this population of students is schema-based instruction (SBI). The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of using SBI to teach word problem solving to students with ASD in the classroom setting. Intervention effectiveness was analyzed and discussed in addition to educational implications and recommendations for future research.

Effectiveness of Computer-assisted Vocabulary Instruction for Secondary Students with Mild Intellectual Disability;"Burt, C.; Graham, L.; Hoang, T.";Students with mild intellectual disabilities need explicit vocabulary instruction with multiple exposures in different contexts and extra practice in associating meanings to unfamiliar words to build their word knowledge. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of multimedia-based computer assisted instruction on learning the meanings of words compared to the identical instruction without computers. Forty, Year 7 to 10 students were explicitly taught vocabulary words either via computer-assisted or teacher-directed instruction. The story Charlotte’s Web was used as a context through a variety of evidenced-based instructional practices. The students’ pre and post tests were based on Read’s Word Associates Format (WAF) vocabulary test. Both the groups significantly improved their scores on post tests and retained most of the new learning five-months later suggesting that a multimedia programme could be used to improve vocabulary knowledge as effectively as a teacher. However, when comparing instructional tasks using Stahl’s Depth of Processing model, there were differences that imply some instructional methods were more suited for multimedia presentation. This has implications for teacher practice regarding when to use computer-assisted instruction with students who have a mild intellectual disability. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;2020;;International Journal of Disability, Development and Education;;;1-22;;10.1080/1034912X.2020.1776849;;#14116;Burt 2020;
Effects of an AAC App with Transition to Literacy Features on Single-Word Reading of Individuals with Complex Communication Needs;"Caron, Jessica; Light, Janice; McNaughton, David";The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Transition to Literacy (T2L) software features (i.e., dynamic text and speech output upon selection of a graphic symbol) within a grid display in an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app on the single-word reading skills of five individuals with severe disabilities and complex communication needs. The study implemented a single-case multiple probe research design across one set of three participants. The same design was utilized with an additional set of two participants. During intervention, the T2L feature was activated for targeted words during a book reading activity. The dependent variable was the number of 10 target words correctly identified. With only limited exposure to the T2L feature, the five participants all demonstrated increased accuracy in identification of 10 target words. Four of the five participants generalized learning to use a text-only display for the 10 target words. This study provides preliminary evidence that redesigning AAC apps to include the provision of dynamic text combined with speech output can positively impact the single-word reading of participants. This adaptation in AAC system design could be used to support improved outcomes in both language and literacy.;2020;06-01;Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities;45;2;115-131;;;;#30406;Caron 2020;

The Effectiveness of a Training Package Prepared to Teach First Aid Skills to Individuals with Intellectual and Additional Disabilities;"Eldeniz Cetin, Müzeyyen; Bozak, Burak";This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a training package, which was applied through direct teaching method and included digital storytelling, a first aid manikin and live modeling, in teaching basic first aid skills necessary for cuts, sprains and bee stings to individuals with intellectual and additional disabilities. Three middle school students with multiple developmental disabilities whose ages ranged from 12 to 15 participated in the study. The first aid skills for simple cuts, sprains and bee stings were taught in a small group format. A multiple probe design across behaviors with probe conditions, one of the single-subject designs, was employed in the study. The independent variable of the study was training package and the dependent variables of the study were the participants' level of acquisition of the target skills (Cut, sprain and bee sting). The results of the study revealed that the package was effective in teaching simple first aid skills to the participants, and they maintained those skills for 1, 3 and 4 weeks after the completion of training. The participants were also able to generalize the skills to other first aid tools, settings and practitioners. Social validity findings showed that the participants enjoyed the classes in which digital storytelling was used. Also, they expressed their desire to have them in other courses.;2020;01-01;International Education Studies;13;3;27-42;;;;#27422;EldenizCetin 2020;
Effectiveness of the direct instruction method in teaching leisure skills to young individuals with intellectual disabilities;Eratay, E.;This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the direct instruction method in teaching young individuals with intellectual disability marbling and stone painting, which are considered among leisure-skills. A multiple probe design, one of the single-subject research methods, was utilized in this research. A total of three students, consisting of two males and one female, were included in the study. Probe, screening, and generalization sessions were used to examine the effectiveness of the direct instruction method in teaching marbling and stone-painting skills. The single opportunity method was employed for the assessment. All sessions were conducted in accordance with a one-to-one teaching procedure. The findings of the study revealed that the direct instruction method was effective in teaching marbling and stone painting skills in young individuals with intellectual disabilities. The findings also postulated that the learned skills were maintained at the end of the first, third, and fourth week, and the participants were capable of generalizing the skills to different settings, different people, and materials. To ensure social validity, the opinions of the parents regarding the skills taught to the participants were obtained. They stated that they were satisfied with the intervention and were beneficial for the development of their children. They also expressed that they want these activities to continue. Considering all these findings, it is safe to say that the intervention of teaching marbling and stone-painting skills are effective. © 2020 Published by T& K Academic.;2020;;International Electronic Journal of Elementary Education;12;5;439-451;;10.26822/iejee.2020562134;;#14089;Eratay 2020;
The Effect of Peer-Mediated Adaptive Physical Activity Program on Problem Behaviors of Mentally Handicapped Students;"Esentürk, Oguz Kaan; Güngör, Nuri Berk";The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of peer-mediated adaptive physical activity program on problem behaviors of mentally handicapped students. Eight mentally handicapped students and eight peer students with normal development participated in this study, which was designed according to a sequential descriptive design. In the research, peer education program was applied to the peer students in line with the skills expected to be exhibited during the practices. In the study, Problem Behavior Sub-Scale (PBS), which is one of the subscales of Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) developed by Gresham and Elliot (1990) and Turkish adaptation by Sucuoglu and Ozokcu (2005) was used as a quantitative data collection tool. As a qualitative data collection tool, semi-structured interview form was used. The Friedman test was used to analyze the quantitative data, and Wilcoxon Signs test was used to determine the source of the difference. Significance value was determined as 0.05. In the analysis of qualitative data, content analysis was applied. The quantitative findings of the study showed that the peer-mediated APA program was effective on the problem behaviors of mentally handicapped students and that the skills acquired as a result of the practice were maintained by the children three weeks after the completion of the practices. In the qualitative findings, the teachers stated that after the peer-mediated APA program, there were positive developments in the ability of mentally handicapped students to experience push-pull, touch discomfort, fear, trust, power control with their peers and to act in accordance with the instructions. The obtained qualitative and quantitative findings showed that peer mediated APA program had positive effects on the problem behaviors of mentally handicapped students.;2020;01-01;Journal of Education and Learning;9;3;163-173;;;;#32236;Esentürk 2020;

Increasing reading skills for students with intellectual disabilities through lively letters;Forney-Misuraca, Barbara;All students can learn how to read, but students with intellectual disabilities (ID) often learn at a slower rate than their peers without disabilities. The purpose of this quantitative, pretest-posttest study design was to analyze whether Lively Letters (LL), a researched-based program, was a useful tool for teaching students with ID to read by using a multisensory approach. The two main theories used were Bandura's social cognitive theory, also known as social learning theory, and Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Sixty-eight students participated in a self-contained program. The students' phonological skills (PA) skills were measured before and after the LL implementation, including differences based on (a) student's language ability (i.e., monolingual or bilingual), (b) the severity of the student's ID (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe), and (c) their grade. Data were analyzed using z test and paired t test. The results indicated significant differences between pre and post scores for 6 of the 9 PA skills and grades, but no statistically significant differences were found based on primary language and severity of ID, and statistically significant differences were found for some, but not all, grades. The implication for a positive social change is that LL can meet the needs of monolingual and bilingual students with ID in learning how to read novel words for both academic and community-based subjects.

Effects of a peer-tutoring system utilizing students with emotional behavioral disorders as tutors and students with intellectual disabilities as tutees;Howell, Vicki;High school students with intellectual disabilities often find appropriate ways and times to socialize with their peers. In self-contained settings, students are often limited to interacting with only those within the classroom. In addition, students with emotional behavioral disorders often have deficits in social domains and in self-esteem. Improving socializations of students with disabilities has always been a concern of both parents and teachers. Peer-mediated learning has been a proven effective way to instruct students with disabilities. Placing a student with an emotional behavioral disorder in the position of a peer tutor allows them to feel more secure in their own skills.A multiple baseline across subject design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-tutoring program in which students with emotional behavioral disorders tutored students with moderate intellectual disabilities with the aim of increasing social initiations in students with moderate intellectual disabilities.

Among other daily living tasks, independent oral hygiene is an essential life skill for people with ID. Materials and Methods Four children with intellectual disabilities (two males and two females, ages 7‐11) participated in the experiment. We employed the KinectTM V2 sensor to gamify oral hygiene skill training. Specifically, a non‐concurrent multiple baseline design was adopted to demonstrate the relation between game‐based intervention and independent oral hygiene skills. Results All students learned how to brush their teeth independently and maintained the skill 4 weeks later with the introduction of the game‐based training. Social validity results showed the teachers and parents considered the video game was useful. Conclusions The proposed Kinect‐based video game might be used for effective training of elementary students with ID to improve oral hygiene independently.

Modifying a naturalistic language intervention for use in an elementary school classroom;"Lane, J.D.; Shepley, C.; Sartini, E.; Hogue, A.";"Background and aims: We evaluated a naturalistic language intervention (NLI) targeting expanded forms of expressive communication (e.g., two-word phrases) for elementary-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID). This study extends the findings of a previous study that evaluated an NLI for preschool-aged children who displayed social communication delays. In the previous study, one child was considered a non-responder to the original intervention; children with similar pre-intervention profiles to the non-responder were recruited for this study to evaluate a modified version of the NLI with a new participant group. Methods: The NLI was evaluated within the context of a multiple probe design across children, with sessions conducted in a public school classroom. The modifications to the NLI resulted in varying dosages of the intervention provided across sessions and children. To analyze the moderating influence of the variation in dosage, we graphed each dosage variable to allow for a formative analysis of changes within and across study conditions. Results: Results indicated increases in the target behavior for all three children when compared to probe sessions; however, for one child the consistency of changes were variable and, as such, may not be socially significant. Conclusions and implications: This study extends the literature on conducting NLIs with minimally verbal children with ASD and ID in dynamic settings, like classrooms. Educators and related professionals can capitalize on natural opportunities for social communication in children who are minimally verbal but imitative by using naturalistic procedures to promote verbalizations during age-appropriate activities. © The Author(s) 2020.";2020;;Autism and Developmental Language Impairments;5;;;;10.1177/2396941519896925;;#14160;Lane 2020;

Developing Social Skills among Individuals with Intellectual Disability using Positive Behavior Intervention and Support.;"Mamta, Kumari; Ahmad, Wasim; Nazli";Background: Good social skills help the individuals to make relationship easy in the community. Individuals with intellectual disability have limited ability to learn social skills due to sub normality of intelligence. Thus, there is need to train them for social skills either by their family or by their teachers in the schools. Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) is one of the effective methods to improve social skills among individuals having inappropriate behavior. Objective: To find out the effect of PBIS on developing social skills among individuals with intellectual disability. Sample: Twenty individuals with intellectual disability were selected and randomly divided in to two groups (Control n=10, Experimental n=10). Design: It was a pre test, post-test control group design. Tool: Social Skills Questionnaire (TEACHER) developed by Spence (1995) was used to collect the data during pre and post tests.

Adsorption of dye on carbon microparticles: Physicochemical properties during adsorption, adsorption isotherm and education for students with special needs [Penjerapan pewarna pada mikrozarah karbon: Sifat fizikokimia semasa penjerapan, isoterma penjerapa;"Maryanti, R.; Nandiyanto, A.B.D.; Manullang, T.I.B.; Hufad, A.; Sunardi";"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the adsorption of dye on carbon microparticles. We conducted two experiments: Understanding of the adsorption of dye on carbon microparticles. We used turmeric solution as a model of dye, in which this solution was contacted into commercially available carbon microparticles in the batch-typed adsorption reactor. The measurement results were then compared to several adsorption isotherm models, such as Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models; and finding teaching strategies to improve students’ understanding on the adsorption concept to students with special needs. As for the second part which is finding strategies to teach the obtained results and their concept of adsorption to students with special needs, we evaluated the strategies to eight students with intellectual disabilities in special schools in Kuningan District, Indonesia using a Single Subject Research method (equipped with pre-test, post-test, and experimental demonstration). The results showed that carbon can absorb dye and can be used as an alternative for wastewater treatment. The isotherm models have the linearity parameter R2 of above 50%, and the most suitable model is Freundlich. The models also confirmed favorable adsorption with multilayer structure and physical interaction between turmeric and carbon microparticles. Demonstrating experiments and informing the measurement results gave great impacts on students’ comprehension, in which they have better understanding about the concept of adsorption compared to the conventional teaching method. © 2020 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

An exploration of task independence for high school students in a self-contained classroom using structured work systems;Otto, Lorinda;This study investigated the effects of a method to support higher levels of independent performance and generalization of skills using a structured work system with a visual schedule when teaching online task completion skills to high school students with ASD and intellectual disabilities. Students with ASD and intellectual disabilities are typically deficient in independent skills. They often struggle to initiate and complete tasks on their own. By learning to complete tasks independently, high school students with ASD and intellectual disabilities gain essential life skills needed for employment. Structured work systems, along with visual schedules, have shown to be useful in teaching sequence, independence, and generalization of skills.The researcher examined a structured work system strategy adapted from the Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children and Adults (TEACCH®) approach. The structured work system combines several strategies, including visual schedules, structured work systems, a structured environment, organized materials, and applied behavior analysis (ABA) strategies (prompts and reinforcers) that comprise the structured teaching approach. This approach is followed at the TEACCH® centers and adapted by therapists and educators who work with students who lack the skills to work independently. A multiple-baseline design across participants explored if a structured work system and a visual schedule can increase task completion while reducing the need for constant adult support.The researcher examined the data results and determined that combining strategies significantly increased three self-contained high school student's level of independence when completing multiple-step tasks. The increase in independent task completion occurred after introducing the structured work system. The structured work system decreased their need for adult prompting, and the participants demonstrated generalization skills across settings, persons, and tasks. Participants maintained their independent levels of accurately completing the tasks with minimal levels of prompting needed three weeks post-treatment. The structured work system is individualized to meet student needs and easily implemented by educators, parents, and other interventionists in various settings.

Utilising children's songs to improve pre-knowledge of body parts in elementary school;"Rusdiyani, I.; Syafrizal, S.; Pratama, T.Y.";Children's Learning abilities are affected by the obstacles of intellectual disabilities so that to optimally develop their ability requires a variety of teaching media. This research, using the application of children's songs in the learning process, is one way to improve the ability in recognising body parts by children with intellectual disabilities. The objective was to find out the increase of recognising body parts in children with intellectual disabilities through the use of song. The method used is an experimental method using single subject research. The research design is A-B-A design. The results show the increase of the ability of children with intellectual disabilities in recognising body parts, after the treatment by using songs. This is indicated by the comparison of the average score in the intervention phase and baseline-2 is higher than in the baseline-1 phase. Based on the results, it can be said that children's songs impact upon children with intellectual disabilities in recognising body parts. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.;2020;;International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change;12;6;285-292;;;;#14130;Rusdiyani 2020;

Encouraging overweight students with intellectual disability to engage in walking/running by using a dance pad combined with a LEGO® Train;"Shih, C.-H.; Lai, M.-C.; Chang, M.-L.; Chang, C.-J.";Most individuals with intellectual disability (ID) lack the motivation and willingness to do exercise on their own. The purpose of this study was to apply the response-stimulation strategy to encourage three overweight students with ID to engage in walking/running. This was a preliminary study to implement the strategy by using a dance pad combined with a LEGO® Train. The LEGO® Train was used as the stimulation to motivate the participants and a dance pad was used to detect the participants’ walking/running activity in order to trigger the LEGO® Train. This study adopted a multiple probe design across participants, including one baseline phase and two intervention phases. The experimental results show that the three participants performed a greater number of walking/running steps during the intervention phases, compared to the baseline phase. The findings demonstrate that a dance pad combined with the LEGO® Train was a feasible motivator to increase the participants’ willingness to perform walking/running on their own. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;2020;;International Journal of Disability, Development and Education;;;;;10.1080/1034912X.2020.1837351;;#14062;Shih 2020;

Effects of psychological guidance and behavioral implications on the cultivation of football consciousness of mentally retarded children;"Yi, B.; Liu, G.; Liu, P.";"The intellectual disability can be effectively alleviated through reasonable and scientific psychological treatment and sports training. This paper mainly explores the effects of psychological guidance and behavioral implications, two intervention methods for cultivating football consciousness, on mentally retarded children. A total of 32 mentally retarded children were selected from a special education class, and subjected to a control experiment. The pre-and post-test data of the subjects were subjected to statistical analysis and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) analysis. The results show that both psychological guidance and behavioral implications greatly promoted the mastery of football knowledge, aroused the interest in football, increased the frequency of football socializing, and enhanced the application of football skills among mentally retarded children; the integration between psychological guidance and behavioral implications outperformed the traditional teaching methods. This research demonstrates the positive impact of football on children's physical and mental health, and provides theoretical support to the treatment of mental retardation in children. © 2020, Fundacion Aigle.";2020;;Revista Argentina de Clinica Psicologica;29;1;595-601;;10.24205/03276716.2020.80;;#14149;Yi 2020;
The effects of the horticulture-mathematics integration program on mathematical attitude and money calculating ability of students with intellectual disabilities;"Yun, S.Y.; Nam, Y.J.; Kwon, Y.I.; Choi, B.J.";Background and objective: The concept of ‘money’ in the numbers and operations domain is a fundamentally necessary domain of economic life. This study was conducted to examine the effects of a horticulture-mathematics integration program on mathematical attitude and money calculating ability of high school students with intellectual disabilities. Methods: We analyzed the changes in the mathematical attitude and money calculating ability of students with mild intellectual disabilities in S special school in the city of D, Republic of Korea, with 12 students in the control group and 12 students in the experimental group, from August 27 to October 29, 2019. Results: The results of the comparison showed no statistically significant changes in the three items of mathematical attitude for the control group, while the experimental group, which took part in the horticulture-mathematics integration program, showed statistically significant differences across all three items, such as self-concept about the subject (p = .003), attitude toward the subject (p = .004), and study habit related to the subject (p = .012). The horticulture-mathematics integration program, which was developed by integrating horticultural activities and the mathematics curriculum, used plants and horticultural activities to provide students with positive experiences in mathematics. These included the sense of closeness, curiosity, interest, attention, and enjoyment, leading to positive changes in mathematical attitude. In terms of money calculating ability, both the control group and experimental group showed statistical differences across the three items, but the experimental group showed greater degrees of increase, 15.0 or more, in the scores compared to the control group. Conclusion: These results suggest that utilizing horticultural materials as a part of purchase learning programs with elements of money calculation chapters in the mathematics curriculum could lead to the improvement of students’ ability in money calculation. These positive changes are thought to be related to the high degrees of interest in horticulture among students, which led to active participation in the program and enabled the simple and repeated purchase activities in the program to generate positive changes in the money calculation ability of the students. © 2020 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.;2020;;Journal of People, Plants, and Environment;23;3;321-332;;10.11628/ksppe.2020.23.3.321;;#13815;Yun 2020;

Improving reading comprehension for students with intellectual disability: The effectiveness of the main idea and self-monitoring strategy;Alussaif, Emad Abdulwahed A.;"Introduction: Students with intellectual disability (ID) experience reading difficulties that can be a result of ineffective reading instruction. Although much research on reading instruction for students with ID has been done, most of this research has focused on sight words and isolated skills, and limited attention has been paid to other literacy skills such as reading comprehension, which is the ultimate goal in literacy. The main idea strategy is one of the reading comprehension strategies that has been found to be effective in improving students' reading comprehension. It has been widely investigated among students with learning disabilities (LD), but little attention has been given to this strategy in improving reading comprehension for students with ID. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature.Objective: This study examined the effectiveness of a main idea and self-monitoring strategy for improving reading comprehension of expository text of students with ID.Method: Three students with ID who were in third, fourth, and fifth grade were selected to participate in the main idea strategy instruction. A multiple baseline, across participants, single-case design was utilized for 10 weeks, with four days of reading instruction sessions per week. After baselines had been established, the main idea and self-monitoring intervention phase was implemented for students as follows: student 1, 16 sessions; student 2, 10 sessions; student 3, 6 sessions. Students were taught for 30 minutes in each session how to generate the main idea from the passage by naming the subject and telling the important things about it. Sixty expository passages were randomly assigned to be used in baseline, intervention, and maintenance. Results: Results revealed the effectiveness of the main idea and self-monitoring strategy in improving reading comprehension for students with ID. All three students' main idea identification mean score increased from the baseline to the intervention phase. Furthermore, during the maintenance phase, results showed all three participants continued to demonstrate an improvement in main idea identification over baseline performance. This suggested that the effects of the main idea intervention were sustained even after two weeks with no instruction. Conclusions: Main idea intervention combined with a self-monitoring strategy was found to be effective in improving reading comprehension of expository passages for students with ID. The findings of this study are promising and provide evidence that students with ID can benefit from reading interventions that have been found to be effective for students with other disabilities (e.g. LD).

Teaching Adolescents with Autism to Text Message Requests Using Video Prompting;"Carrero, Kelly M.; Fuller, Marcus C.";Mobile technology provides increasingly accessible and normative tools for communication that does not require intelligible oral expression. For adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and complex communication needs, mobile technology presents opportunities for inclusive social experiences and additional modalities for communicating with communicative partners (e.g., making a request to a partner who may or may not be within close proximity). This study examines using video prompting to teach four adolescent males with ASD, intellectual disability, and limited verbal expression of how to emit pictures to communication partners using text messaging technology. Results indicate acquisition was achieved and maintained when presented under the same conditions for three of the four participants. Attentional concerns were observed in the intervention sessions and warrant future investigation.;2021;03-01;Journal of Special Education Technology;36;1;44-53;;;;#30900;Carrero 2021;

Music Therapy in Enhancing Learning Attention of Children with Intellectual Disability;"Dada, A.O.; Adeleke, O.P.; Aderibigbe, S.A.; Adefemi, M.A.; Apie, M.A.";Inattention is one of the significant problems that inhibit learning among children with intellectual disabilities. However, several strategies and therapies have been developed to solve the problem. This study, therefore, investigates the effectiveness of music therapy in enhancing attention among children with intellectual disability. A pretest-posttest control experimental research design was adopted. The experiment was carried out for six weeks using Music Therapy Treatment Package on 24 children with intellectual disability that were randomly selected Modupe Cole Momerial Childcare and Treatment Home/School, Akoka, Yaba, Lagos. A validated Attention Observation Rating Scale (AORS) with a reliability coefficient of 0.88 was used for this study. Three hypotheses were tested in the study, and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used for data analysis. This study revealed that music therapy is effective in enhancing attention among children with intellectual disabilities. Sex and level of severity of the disability were also tested as moderator variables, but they have no significant main or interaction effect with music therapy in enhancing attention for children with intellectual disability. The finding is that music therapy is significantly effective in enhancing attention for children with intellectual disability regardless of their sex or level of severity. It was concluded that attention deficit could with adequate teacher training. © 2021 Lifescience Global;2021;;Journal of Intellectual Disability - Diagnosis and Treatment;9;4;363-367;;10.6000/2292-2598.2021.09.04.2;;#16313;Dada 2021;
The Effect of Unplugged Coding Education for Special Education Students on Problem-Solving Skills;Demir, Ümit;"During recent years coding education has been an important issue in many countries. Coding education has been an important topic for these countries. One of the reasons why coding education is being discussed by educators and other partners of the schools is that it is seen as a key competence for students, and workers at developing problem-solving skills. Coding as an academic skill is seen as a part of logical reasoning. Coding is also accepted as one of the skills called ""21st-century skills"" required from individuals. Special education students are in a disadvantaged situation as in other learning platforms. Thus, this study aims to analyze the place of coding education in developing problem-solving skills of special education students. Within the scope of the study, unplugged coding applications were carried out with the participation of 34 students having mild intellectual disabilities who are continuing their education in a special education vocational school aged between 14 and 18. A question form was used to evaluate problem-solving skills. There was a significant difference between the pre-course and post-course skills of the students. Students' average scores of problem-solving skills in the post-course was higher than their average scores in the pre-course. The analysis of the findings showed that the students' skill scores in using problem-solving steps have increased in all these steps.";2021;01-01;International Journal of Computer Science Education in Schools;4;1;;;;;#26818;Demir 2021;

Increasing Problem-Solving Ability for Students with Visual Impairments and Intellectual Disabilities.;"Johnson, Nicole; Brawand, Anne";Introduction: Despite the national effort to focus on prioritization of mathematical concepts, teachers of students with sensory and cognitive disabilities often do not know how to provide quality instruction to address mathematical skills. Research is limited for this population of students in the area of mathematics. This study is a replication of previous research to determine whether schema-based instruction (SBI) increases problem-solving ability for students with concurrent visual impairments and intellectual disabilities at the secondary level. Method : A multiple-baseline-across-students design was used to study the effects of SBI on problem-solving skills of three high school students with concurrent visual impairments and intellectual disabilities. During the four-to-five-week intervention sessions, students utilized the find, organize, plan, and solve (FOPS) strategy to solve addition and subtraction word problems. Results: The three students improved their problem-solving );2021;;Journal of Blindness Innovation & Research;11;1;N.PAG-N.PAG;;;;#34445;Johnson 2021;
Comparing the Solitary and Tablet Assisted Presentations of Direct Instruction Method in Teaching Science Topics to Students with Intellectual Disabilities;"Karabulut, H. Aysun; Yikmis, Ahmet";The purpose of the study is to determine whether the solitary and tablet assisted presentations of direct instruction method differed in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in teaching science topics to students with intellectual disabilities and to obtain the opinions of participating students and their real-time teachers about two different instructions. The participants were four male students who had been diagnosed with intellectual disability. Adapted alternating treatments model, among single-subject research designs, was used in the study. The research findings indicated that the solitary and tablet assisted presentations of direct instruction method were both effective in teaching respiratory system and digestive system topics to students with mental disabilities, the participants could generalize what they had acquired to different settings and people, and they preserved what they had learnt 10, 20, and 35 days after the instruction was over. The productivity findings of the study implied that the tablet assisted presentation of the direct instruction method was more efficient. Social validity findings uncovered that students and teachers had positive opinions about the study.;2021;01-01;Education Quarterly Reviews;4;;362-377;;;;#30118;Karabulut 2021;

Improving behavior of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities with computer-assisted literacy instruction: An experimental comparison;LeJeune, Lauren M.;Students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) require intensive supports to make progress on literacy goals. These supports must often include methods to decrease challenging behaviors and increase engagement during instruction. In this study, I investigated whether computer-assisted instruction (CAI) may be one effective method to improve student behavior. I included three participants with IDD who were between 7 and 9 years old and who engaged in challenging behaviors during instruction. I collected information on participants' interest in technology through teacher report and direct preference assessments. I then used a single case alternating treatments design to compare levels of challenging behavior, academic engagement, and mastery test scores during paper-based and CAI (i.e., tablet computer-based) literacy instruction. Results indicated that CAI was associated with decreased challenging behavior and increased academic engagement for two of three participants and higher mastery test scores for one participant. These results had moderate to high correspondence with pre- intervention assessment results. Although teacher and student measures of social validity were positive, there was limited evidence that results maintained. These findings are described in relation to their limitations, future directions for research, and impact on practitioners.

Manipulating Algebra: Comparing Concrete and Virtual Algebra Tiles for Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities;"Long, Holly; Bouck, Emily; Domka, Anna";Limited research exists to target algebra instruction for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). In this study, researchers compared the use of concrete -- with scaffolds added by researchers -- and virtual algebra tiles -- with inherent scaffolds -- to support the acquisition, fluency, and generalization of linear algebra for three middle school students with IDD. In the single case alternating treatments design, all three participants were successful in solving two-step addition and subtraction linear algebra problems with both manipulative types. Students were successful in best treatment sessions, but struggled to generalize to solving the problems without the use of the either manipulative. This study contributes to the limited literature on algebra instruction for students with IDD and suggests both concrete and virtual algebra tiles can successful support students with linear algebra.;2021;01-01;Exceptionality;29;3;197-214;;;;#27463;Long 2021;

The effect of training on variability and accuracy of overhand throwing in children with Down syndrome;"Noghondar, Narges Vali; Sohrabi, Mehdi; Taheri, Hamid Reza; Kobravi, Hamid Reza; Khodashenas, Ezzat";Objective: People with Down syndrome (DS) have higher variability in their motor skills compared to other counterparts without intellectual disability. Given that the effect of physical training on the variability and accuracy is unclear, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of nine sessions of overhand throwing training on the variability and accuracy of overhand throwing in children with DS. Methods: Twenty-seven children with DS randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In the pretest, two groups threw the tennis ball three times to the fixed target. Absolute error (AE) and the normalized root mean square (NoRMS) of segmental couplings of shoulder-elbow (NoRMS 1) and elbow-wrist (NoRMS 2) calculated from the scores of throwing and kinematics data, respectively. Then the experimental group participated in overhand throwing training for nine sessions. After that, the post-test was taken and ten days later, the retention test performed with pretest conditions. Results: The results of two-way ANOVA with repeated measures on AE values showed the experimental group in the post-test and retention phases was more accurate than the control group. Also, AE values of the experimental group in the post-test and retention phases were significantly lower than the pretest. The results of two-way ANOVA with repeated measures showed that NoRMS 1 in the experimental group was significantly lower than control group in the post-test and retention phases. Conclusion: It seems the overhand throwing training can reduce the variability and increase the accuracy of overhand throwing in children with DS.

Motor action accuracy training technology for schoolchildren with minor mental retardation;"Pravdov, D.M.; Pravdov, M.A.; Kornev, A.V.; Nikiforov, Y.B.";Objective of the study was to develop and test benefits of a new motor action accuracy training model for the 12-13 year-old minor-mental-retardation-diagnosed children, with a set of exercise balls varied in weights and sizes and postural control tools. Methods and structure of the study. We sampled the 12-13 year-old minor-mental-retardation-diagnosed children (n= 42) from a correctional boarding school in Shuya (Ivanovo Oblast) for a 5-month motor action accuracy training model testing experiment. The Experimental Group was training was complemented by the motor action accuracy advancement model using a set of exercise balls varied in weights and sizes with a special postural control toolkit geared to help improve the motor controls by exercises with spatial control requirements and limitations including fixations of limbs and other parts of the musculoskeletal system. The ball throwing exercises were grouped basically by the ball sizes and weights into five groups: see Table 1. The ball surfaces and elasticity (leather, plastic, rubber, pimpled etc.) were also different to excel the tactile sensations. Conclusion. The new motor action accuracy training model for the minor-mental-retardation-diagnosed 12-13 year-old schoolchildren was tested beneficial as verified by the Experimental Group making significant progress versus Reference Group in the motor control and balls throw on target tests. Thus the post-experimental target hitting accuracy tests with the 3/ 5/ 7m far targets yielded 89%/ 76%/ 74% accuracy rates for the Experimental Group, respectively, that were significantly higher than in the Reference Group. © 2021, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

Design, implementation and evaluation of a technical platform that supports spanish speaking children with intellectual disabilities learn english as a second language;"Rojas, L.; Sorbello, K.; Contreras, P.; Calderon, J.F.";Recent Chilean legislation established a curriculum focused on children with cognitive deficits, adapting the original English curriculum to a specialized one that can be used in Special Education Needs (SEN) schools. However, currently, Chilean SEN schools are not making use of these methods to support students to learn a new language such as English. Furthermore, the research of similar mobile applications available indicated a focus on native English speaking children with intellectual disabilities, however, did not support Spanish speaking children. Therefore, this study was created to observe the impact of mobile activities in English language instruction in the setting of a Chilean SEN school. The proposed solution was designed, developed, and implemented in conjunction with specialist teachers. Prototypes of the mobile application were installed on tablets specifically for this study and deployed in an experimental group. Students were assigned to two groups, control and experimental, where the same pre and post-tests were conducted. This included activities such as writing an English word from the image displayed, matching an image with the associated English word, and completing the missing letters of an English word (which was proven to be the most difficult activity). This experiment resulted in a significant impact on the learning achieved in the experimental group. The Cohen D resulted in 0.92 with a p-value of <0.001. Furthermore, the analysis of the standard deviation of time usage in each activity provided insights into the difficulty levels supporting modifications of future activities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.;2021;;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);12775 LNCS;;257-269;;10.1007/978-3-030-77685-5_21;;#16265;Rojas 2021;
Augmented reality for teaching personal finance skills in the community;Romano, Shannon B.;The ability to manage one's personal finances is an indicator for success and autonomy among adolescents preparing for adulthood. Accessing and spending money allows an individual to participate in preferred social and recreational activities within the community. For individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID), however, personal finance skills that afford opportunities for community participation are hindered by the limited adaptive skills associated with having ID and increased reliance on family and staff. These limiting factors can diminish an individual's self-determination and overall quality of life. The United States Department of Health and Human Services and The World Health Organization both identify the need for technologies that can improve accessibility in communities for individuals with ID. Therefore, this study used a multiple-probe design to examine the effectiveness of a video-modeling intervention, delivered through an augmented reality application, for teaching youth with ID to perform personal finance skills in their community. Results of the study show the intervention was effective for teaching the participants to withdraw money from an ATM and to pay for items using a debit card. Additionally, three of the four participants found the intervention to be a socially acceptable method for accessing instruction while in the community.

Inclusive structured inquiry-based social studies content instruction for students with significant intellectual and developmental disabilities;Ryan, Joanna Hanes;The National Council for the Social Studies recommends high-quality access to academic content in the social studies domains (history, government, economics, and civics) to improve in-school performance and postschool civic and community outcomes for students in K-12 schools. To date, limited research information exists to inform social studies curriculum content and instructional procedures for students with significant intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). A consideration of grade-level aligned and high-quality instruction in social studies curriculum domains during the school years may be especially important for students with significant IDD. Information about evidenced ways to provide social studies instruction may help to promote improvements in graduates' postschool civic, employment, and social outcomes. Structured inquiry-based processes, and other instructional methods that teach pivotal problem-solving skills, may especially help to promote improved lifelong outcomes. The research study described in this dissertation examined the effects of an inclusive, peer supported, structured inquiry-based intervention to teach Utah Studies and US history content for three students with significant IDD at a junior high school. A multiple probe across participants design was used to investigate the relationship between the intervention and students' percentages of correct responding to content probes. Study results suggest that the intervention was strongly associated with improvements in students' percentage of correct responses to acquisition probes and that, after repeated practice, students were able to use the inquiry-based process with untaught instructional materials. General education teachers and paraprofessionals found the intervention to be effective and acceptable. Implications for future research, implications for classroom practice, and study limitations are discussed.

A study on developing creative thinking skills in students with intellectual disabilities using creative drama;Şahin, Feyzullah;ABSTRACT Creative thinking is found more or less in each individual, and is a skill that can be learned. Creative drama is one of the methods used to acquire this skill. This study examined the effect of applying the creative drama approach for the development of creative thinking skills in students with imtellectual disabilities. The study was carried out using a randomized pretest–post test control group design. A modified version of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking Figural Form “Circles” was used as the data collection tool. The fluency and flexibility scores of the students were evaluated. The activities were carried out in 2–hour sessions two days a week for a total of 32 hours. The experimental group fluency and flexibility post test and follow–up test scores were significantly higher than their pre–test scores, while no significant difference was found between the post test and follow–up results. As a result of the study, it was concluded that the improvement of the students’ fluency and flexibility scores was linked to the activities, i.e., that the creative drama method had contributed positively to the development of creative thinking skills of students with intellectual disabilities.

Literacy instruction and intervention for middle school students with mild intellectual disability;Shelton, Alexandra Elizabeth;Research reveals that many individuals with mild intellectual disability (ID) face significant challenges in foundational literacy skills that hinder their ability to comprehend texts. Thus, individuals with mild ID need access to instruction and intervention that target reading comprehension effectively. However, the extent to which interventions can improve reading comprehension among individuals with mild ID has been unclear. Therefore, the current dissertation was conducted to explore literacy instruction and intervention for individuals with mild ID. Chapter 2 of the dissertation is a synthesis of interventions targeting reading comprehension among individuals with mild ID. The purpose of the synthesis was to identify common features as well as determine the effectiveness of these interventions for individuals with mild ID. Chapter 3 presents findings from a mixed-method study, designed based on findings from the synthesis presented in Chapter 2. The study included an intervention intended to improve the main idea identification skills of one middle school student with mild ID. The student received sentence-level comprehension instruction, and a subsequent interview of the student's special education teacher helped interpret the findings of the intervention in the context of the entire class. This mixed-method study as well as the Chapter 2 synthesis informed the practitioner manuscript presented in Chapter 4. The practitioner manuscript explains how teachers can provide middle school students with ID explicit instruction on using a main idea identification strategy, supplemented with instructional scaffolds, other forms of instruction, and peer-mediated practice to support students' comprehension of grade-level texts.The current dissertation yields several important findings. First, the synthesis revealed that explicit instruction and peer-mediated practice improve reading comprehension among individuals with mild ID. Second, the findings of the mixed-method study suggest that middle school students with mild ID require main idea instruction—supplemented with background information and vocabulary instruction—as well as phonics instruction to support reading comprehension. These features were incorporated into the instructional approach outlined in the practitioner manuscript. Areas for future research are discussed throughout the dissertation.

Implementation and evaluation of computer-assisted science vocabulary modules with students with an intellectual disability and autism: An action research study;Taber, Jamie Lee;Students with disabilities are struggling to meet expectations in science at the national and local level. Many studies have linked difficulties with science content to difficult and technical vocabulary, and this has been evident at the local level, too. To try to improve science instruction for students with disabilities, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of computer-assisted science vocabulary modules with students with an intellectual disability and autism in an adapted environmental science class. This study aimed to answer how the implementation of computer-assisted vocabulary modules, which adhere to evidence-based practices of special education vocabulary instruction, affected the acquisition and application of science vocabulary terms with students with an intellectual disability and autism in an adapted environmental science class, as well as how the students were engaged in the computer-assisted instruction activities.This study implemented an action research design. The participants in this study included three students (n = 3) who were diagnosed with a moderate intellectual disability, autism, and a speech/language impairment who attended a weekly adapted environmental science class at their self-contained school. The students participated in computer-assisted vocabulary modules which included computer-assisted instruction features, vocabulary strategies including keyword mnemonics and graphic organizers, and the special education evidence-based practice of explicit instruction. The modules were developed surrounding the topic of photosynthesis, using Gagne's nine events of instruction, psycholinguistic/schema theory, and dual coding theory, as well as South Carolina-Alt performance level descriptors. The effectiveness of the computer-assisted vocabulary modules was measured through data collection which included a pre- and posttest, formative assessments in each module, the Classroom Measurement of Achievement Engagement, and a researcher's journal. The data collected were analyzed using a convergent parallel mixed methods design. The findings of this study suggested the use of computer-assisted instruction and evidence-based explicit vocabulary instruction could improve science vocabulary acquisition and active engagement in instruction for students with an intellectual disability and autism.

Effect of dog-assisted therapy on psychomotor development of children with intellectual disability;"Wolan-Nieroda, A.; Dudziak, J.; Drużbicki, M.; Pniak, B.; Guzik, A.";Background: Although dog-assisted therapy (DAT) has been used for years, there is still a scarcity of research findings confirming efficacy of the method. The current study was designed to assess effects of DAT on psychomotor development of children with mild intellectual disabilities. Material and method: The study involved 60 children with mild intellectual disabilities, aged 10–13 years, divided into a group participating in a 10-month DAT program, and the control group. Four tests were applied, i.e., finger identification, postural imitation, kinaesthesia, and Bourdon-Wiersma Dot Cancellation Test. The examinations were carried out before the start and at the end of the DAT, and at a two-month follow-up. Results: The results obtained by the DAT group in all the four tests, at all the three timepoints, were not the same (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in the measurement at the end of the therapy between the DAT group and the controls. On the other hand, the DAT group achieved significantly better scores (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001), compared to the control, in the follow-up measurements two months after the end of the therapy in postural imitation and finger identification tests. Conclusions: Some of the scores achieved by the children in the DAT group improved in the measurements performed over time. Two months after the therapy ended, the children in the DAT group presented greater gains in motor planning (postural imitation test) and in the sense of touch, attention, and concentration (finger identification test), compared to the control group. Although the measurement performed immediately after the therapy did not show significant differences between the DAT group and the controls, the examination carried out at the two-month follow-up identified long-term gains in the treatment group in the domain of motor planning (postural imitation test). © 2020 by the authors.

Effectiveness of Integrating Drawing in Teaching English Language in Intellectual Disability Classroom;"Alhassan, Bawa; Osei, Mavis";Children with intellectual disabilities have difficulties in language acquisition and learning in general and therefore demands specialized and effective instructional strategies. For this reason, the purpose of this study was to examine effectiveness of integrating drawing, as a specialized instruction, in teaching English Language to children with intellectual disabilities. Quasi-experiment was employed with which pre-test and post-test of both control and experimental groups were analyzed. The results saw the experimental group performing better in the post-test results as compared to the control group, proving that integrating drawing in teaching English Language is an effective instructional strategy. Therefore, the researchers recommend that teachers and other educational implementers working with children with intellectual disabilities should consider integrating drawing in teaching and learning of English Language.;2022;01-01;International Journal on Social and Education Sciences;4;1;74-86;;;;#29188;Alhassan 2022;

Effects of neuromuscular training on postural control of children with intellectual disability and developmental coordination disorders: Neuromuscular training and postural control;"Balayi, E.; Sedaghati, P.; Ahmadabadi, S.";Background: Children with Intellectual disabilities who suffer from developmental coordination disorder represent insignificant physical fitness, strength, and balance. The prime objective of this research is to explore the impact of eight weeks of neuromuscular (combined physio-hemsball) training on postural control and balance of students with intellectual disabilities suffering from developmental coordination disorder. Methods: The present study was a prospective randomized clinical trial with a pretest–posttest design. The statistical population consisted of boys with intellectual disabilities, suffering from developmental coordination disorder randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 15). informed consent was obtained from all participants’ parents. Parents completed developmental coordination disorder questionnaires. Tests (Balance Error Scoring System, Y-Balance, timed Get Up & Go) were used to determine postural control, dynamic balance, and functional balance of subjects. The experimental group performed a combined physio-hemsball training for 8 weeks. Ethical considerations were observed according to the Helsinki Declaration and the CONSORT guidelines and regulations were followed to report this study. Results: Results showed that combined physio-hemsball training for 8 weeks can greatly improve postural control and dynamic and postural balance among students with intellectual disabilities suffering from developmental coordination disorder. Conclusions: According to the results, instructors can use this type of training to improve postural control and balance in boys with intellectual disabilities enduring developmental coordination disorders.

Teaching students with significant cognitive disabilities to solve mathematical word problems: A mixed methods study;Bowman, Jessica Ashlee;Given the persistent focus of the field of special education on providing students with significant cognitive disabilities (SCD) access to the general education curriculum, very little research exists on how to provide this access within general education contexts. Many experts agree that true access to the general curriculum is multifaceted and includes access to general education contexts, teachers, peers, and activities. In addition, there is a lack of research on teaching students with SCD mathematical skills in ways that align with best practice according to mathematics education experts. To address these gap areas, this research study sought to combine mathematics instructional strategies from special education literature (i.e., the concrete-semiconcrete-abstract instructional sequence, explicit and systematic instruction, and embedded instruction) and reconcile it with some of the mathematical practices in the Common Core State Standards (e.g., making sense of problems and solving them, using mathematical models, communicating about their findings). This study used a mixed method design to investigate the impact of a multicomponent mathematics intervention on the mathematical word problem solving, strategy use, and concept acquisition of three elementary-aged students with SCD in general education classrooms. Findings of a single-case multiple probe design indicate that students learned to solve change type word problems using concrete and semiconcrete materials. However, the school year ended before students could master solving the word problems using abstract materials. According to qualitative data analysis all three students used both learned and invented strategies to successfully solve the word problems. Lastly, while addition and subtraction were taught simultaneously, all participants demonstrated acquisition of addition before subtraction. This research study demonstrates how embedded instruction can be used to provide students with SCD access to individualized mathematics instruction for a more complex mathematics skill while not interrupting their participation in the routines of the general education classroom. Findings also indicated several implications for practitioners as well as new areas for future research in the area of mathematics instruction for students with SCD.

Early Reading Outcomes in Response to a Comprehensive Reading Curriculum for Students With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability;"Conner, Carlin; Allor, Jill H.; Al Otaiba, Stephanie; Yovanoff, Paul; LeJeune, Lauren";This study examined the response of two students with autism spectrum disorder and IQ in the intellectual disability range to a comprehensive, text-based reading intervention. The intervention, Friends on the Block, includes multiple strands of literacy providing explicit instruction in phonics, phonemic awareness, high-frequency irregular or temporarily irregular words, decoding, vocabulary, oral language, and comprehension. Multiple supports for students with intensive needs are embedded within the intervention, such as specially designed multi-criteria books, extensive scaffolding, and intensive cumulative review. Teachers customize the program to address the varying needs of students. We used single-case multiple baselines across levels of instruction design to assess growth on a measure of reading (words read correctly). Results indicated a positive, functional relation between reading intervention and word reading. Both students also demonstrated modest growth on measures of phonemic awareness, letter–sound knowledge, and word identification from pre- to post-intervention. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2022.;2022;2022;Focus on Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities;;;;;10.1177/10883576221137905;;#42023;Conner 2022;scopus_update
An Examination of the Impact of Game-Based Geometric Shapes Education Software Usage on the Education of Students With Intellectual Disabilities;Demir, Ümit;Purpose: This study aims to research the impact of the e-learning environment, in which game-based education software was used, on the learning of students with intellectual disabilities. Design/Approach/Methods: The study group consisted of 34 students with intellectual disabilities studying at a special education vocational school in Çanakkale, Turkey. In this study, the true experimental method was used. For 5 weeks, the experimental group received blended learning that was supported by the usage of a game-based education software designed by the researcher, which includes interactive educational game applications. At the same time, control group students only received the teaching process in the classroom with the traditional teaching method. A course attitude scale and an achievement test were used for data collection. Findings: The analysis of the findings showed that there was a significant increase between pre-course and post-course attitudes and academic achievement scores of the students. There wasn’t a significant difference between pre-course and post-course attitudes and academic achievement scores according to the gender and academic achievement scores. Males’ academic achievement and attitude post-test scores were higher than females’ scores. Students having upper daily mobile devices usage experience had higher post-test and academic achievement scores than students having lower daily mobile devices usage experience. Originality/Value: This article has the potential to construct a new practice example as a supplement for analyzing the game-based educational software usage on the education of students with intellectual disabilities. As a pilot study, it provides a good sample for further investigations. © The Author(s) 2020.;2022;2022;ECNU Review of Education;5;4;761 – 783;;10.1177/2096531120940721;;#41462;Demir 2022;scopus_update

The Effectiveness of Sports Programs in Improving the Social Interaction of Children with Down Syndrome;"Hassan, Ahmed K.; Elsayed, Ahmed R.";Paying attention to learners with special needs is essential to achieving the principle of equal educational opportunities for all. This study is aimed at determining the effectiveness of sports programs in improving the social interaction of children with Down syndrome. The sample consisted of 12 children with Down syndrome. Their ages ranged from 8 to 14 years, and their IQ ranged from 50 to 70. They were from Al Najashi School in Al Hofuf, Al Hasa. The children were asked questions to gain preliminary data about children with Down syndrome. A scale was used to measure and assess their social interaction, and the efficacy of the sports programs in their social interaction was obtained. The results show that there are differences in the social interaction of group members in the test conducted before participation in the program (pre-test) as compared to the test conducted after participation in the program (post-test). There are also statistically significant differences among the experimental and control groups in their social interaction, in favor of the experimental group. There were no differences in the social interaction in the experimental group between the post-and follow-up tests. This shows the effectiveness of sports programs in improving social interaction in children with Down syndrome, as well as the continuing effectiveness in improving social interaction for these children during the follow-up period. The study recommends that sports programs be used to improve social interaction skills in children with Down syndrome. © 2022 by authors, all rights reserved.;2022;2022;International Journal of Human Movement and Sports Sciences;10;1;31 – 37;;10.13189/saj.2022.100105;;#41815;Hassan 2022;scopus_update

Providing Access to Reading Comprehension for Greek Secondary Students with Mild Intellectual Disabilities;"Ladias, Georgios; Iatraki, Georgia; Soulis, Spyridon-Georgios";All students should achieve improved outcomes in academic content within general classroom and access information through reading comprehension during their daily interactions. Several adaptations and recommendations should be required for students with intellectual disabilities to access information, such as adapted texts that can provide access to reading comprehension and help them participate equally in modern society. The current study shows promise for the use of easy to read (EtR) material combined with systematic instruction, task analysis, and prompting in facilitating Greek language lessons for students with mild intellectual disabilities. Researchers used an AB single-subject design to evaluate the effects of transcribed EtR texts for providing access to information regarding grade-aligned reading comprehension in Greek language lessons. Students with mild intellectual disabilities were assessed through baseline and intervention phases and their results showed a correlational relation between the intervention supported by EtR material and the number of students' correct responses on the comprehension probes. In addition, social validity indicated the teaching intervention through adapted EtR texts as being practical and useful. Discussion of results, future research, and limitations are provided with a focus of the importance of teaching interventions based on EtR language that positively contribute to the accessibility and equality of people with intellectual disabilities to information.;2022;2022-12;EDUCATION SCIENCES;12;12;;;10.3390/educsci12120921;;#40499;Ladias 2022;wos_update
Evaluating the utility of interview-informed synthesized contingency analyses in informing the treatment of problem behavior among children with autism spectrum disorder;"Lundy, E.; Healy, O.; Ramey, D.; Carolan, T.; Dempsey, R.; Holloway, J.";Although functional analysis is a widely researched tool for determining behavioral function, traditional formats are associated with limitations that often preclude their incorporation into practice. The interview-informed synthesized contingency analysis (IISCA) was developed to address such limitations. This study investigated the effectiveness and efficiency of the IISCA in determining the function of problem behavior for three non-vocal children with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in a school setting. The effectiveness of the skill-based treatment process associated with the IISCA was also evaluated, as were the acceptability of these treatment procedures and the fidelity with which they were implemented. The IISCAs yielded differentiated outcomes immediately for two participants and following a secondary analysis for the third participant. Assessment results informed the design of treatments involving functional communication training and delay- and denial-tolerance training evaluated using a changing-criterion design. Implications and limitations are discussed and recommendations for future research are offered. © 2021 Norwegian Association for Behavior Analysis.;2022;;European Journal of Behavior Analysis;23;1;109-133;;10.1080/15021149.2021.1981752;;#15728;Lundy 2022;

EFFECT OF A METHOD FOR DEVELOPING COMMUNICATION SKILLS ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN CHILDREN WITH IN℡LECTUAL DISABILITIES.;"Mkrtchyan, Hasmik; Margaryan, Tatev; Hovhannisyan, Hripsime; Petrosyan, Tigran";Background. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a selected special education method on the level of physical activity in schoolchildren with intellectual disability. Material and methods. The study was conducted on 32 children with rather similar backgrounds: all participants were Armenians with no medical history of any registered disorders and the same moderate degree of intellectual disability (IQ score = 35-49). A physical education program based on two games using the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) was conducted for three months by a physical educator trained in PECS. The level of habitual physical activity before and after the study period was assessed by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for children (PAIC-A) and pedometry (Omron HJ-112, Illinois, USA).

Teaching reading and writing to students with intellectual disabilities based on stimulus equivalence instruction.;"Muto, Jéssica H. D.; Postalli, Lidia Maria M.";The formation of stimulus equivalence classes has been considered a productive model of symbolic relations - or meaning - for teaching reading and writing. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of one module of a computerized reading and writing program for children with intellectual disabilities enrolled in a regular school. Three students aged between 8 and 10 participated in the study. The program was applied individually to each participant in the school premises across two to three weekly sessions of approximately 35 minutes each. General assessment was applied as a pre and post-test. The results showed that the better the participants' existing repertoires, the faster they advanced in the procedure and improved their reading and writing skills. Conducting this intervention in early school years can contribute to the process of leaning basic reading and writing.

A comparison of variations of prompt delay during instruction on an expressive labeling task;"O'Neill, Sean J.; McDowell, Claire; Leslie, Julian C.";Variations in prompt delay procedures are used in discrete-trial training to reduce the occurrence of errors before task mastery. However, the variations are seldom compared systematically. Using an adapted alternating treatments design, the present study compared progressive prompt delay with 2-s or 5-s constant prompt delay, on the acquisition of an expressive labeling task in four participants with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. While all three prompt delay methods led to mastery of the tasks, albeit only when the tasks were simplified for one participant, progressive prompt delay generally proved the most efficient method on several measures, including lower error rates. This is consistent with the nature of the progressive prompt delay procedure which allows less time for errors to occur early in training. It is provisionally concluded that selection of progressive prompt delay is supported as a wise first choice option for clinicians, as a history of high error rates may impair later learning.

Effects of Graphic Organizers and Socio-Economic Status on Acquisition of Social Skills among Pupils with Intellectual Disability in Ibadan;Oladimeji, Oyeyemi Omolayo;Pupils with Intellectual Disability (PwID) experience difficulties with acquisition of social skills. They find it difficult to initiate and maintain positive social relationships. Previous studies focused on enhancing academic skills of PwID with little emphasis on fostering functional skills. Therefore, this study determined the effects of Graphic Organizers (GO) strategy on acquisition of social skills among PwID. Three special schools were purposively selected. Twenty-six pupils that scored between 20 and 55 in the Screening test were adopted. Participants were randomly assigned to GOS (13) and control (13) for ten weeks. Slosson Intelligent Test (r=0.95) and Pupils Social Development Checklist (r=0.80) were used. Data were analyzed using Analysis of covariance and Scheffe post-hoc test at 0.05 level of significance. There was a significant main effect of treatment on acquisition of social skills (F=12.200, p<0.05, [eta-squared]=0.347). Participants in GOS group obtained the highest mean score (33.37) and control (27.40). Graphic organizers strategy fostered acquisition of social skills of PwID. Therefore, the strategy should be adopted in teaching PwID.;2022;01-01;Online Submission;11;1;10-18;;;;#27517;Oladimeji 2022;original_search
Using songs to teach students with intellectual disabilities to tell time;Özler, N.G.;The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using songs to teach students with intellectual disabilities to tell time. It followed a multiple-probe, across-subject design with a probe phase, which is a single-subject research design. The participants were three 17–19-year-old female students with mild intellectual disabilities who could not read clocks. They were taught to read analog clocks at full, half, and quarter past hours. Graphical analysis was used to analyze the data on the effectiveness of teaching through songs. At the end of the study, it was evaluated whether the students could read clocks without singing. Social validity data were collected from the students and their teachers. The findings show that all three students could learn to read clocks through songs and could tell the time correctly without songs. In the social validity data, the students stated that they were able to learn to tell time easily without getting bored and they wanted other lessons to also be taught through songs. The teachers stated that the students participated in the lesson more willingly than usual and that they enjoyed learning to tell time. ©2022 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

Effectiveness of Video Modeling in Teaching Computer Skills to Students with Intellectual Disabilities;"Özler, Naime Günes; Akçamete, Gönül";The purpose of this study is to determine whether video modeling is effective in teaching computer skills to students with intellectual disabilities. The study was designed with the multiple probe design across subjects, one of the single-subject research designs. The study was conducted with three female students with intellectual disabilities, who were 17-19 years old. Graphical analysis was used to analyze the data. The results show that video modeling was effective for them to acquire and retain skills for preparing a résumé, printing it out, and emailing it. However, the students had difficulties generalizing some of the skills on different computers and printers. It can be said that the reason for this originates from different designs of technological tools. In line with this, it is thought that removing the accessibility barrier in technological equipment will increase availability. The video modeling motivated students to learn computer skills. The participants reported that they could use these skills to do homework, apply for a job, and communicate with friends.;2022;01-01;Journal of Education and Learning;11;1;40-53;;;;#28271;Özler 2022;
Teacher-delivered virtual manipulative mathematics intervention to individuals with extensive support needs;"Park, Jiyoon; Bouck, Emily";While mathematics is foundational to further academic learning and post-school outcomes for students with disabilities, research and practice specifically for those students has not received significant attention. Moreover, an insufficient number of studies have sought to verify the effectiveness of interventions delivered by teachers who work directly with students with extensive support needs (ESN). The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of an intervention—the virtual manipulatives-based instructional sequence—in teaching equivalent fractions delivered by the special education teacher who worked regularly with the students. Among three students aged from 15 to 17, all acquired the skill and one of the three maintained the skill up to eight weeks later. With additional strategy (i.e., self-monitoring), the other two students maintained the skill. The study also addressed limitations and future directions. © 2022;2022;2022;Research in Developmental Disabilities;131;;;;10.1016/j.ridd.2022.104339;;#41513;Park 2022;scopus_update
Skill Building for Teachers at a Chinese Special Needs School through International Videophone Teleconsultation: Helping Teachers Develop and Improve Choice-making in Students with Intellectual Disabilities.;"Pei, Hong; Sonoyama, Shigeki";In cooperation with a special needs school in China, we conducted an international consultation by videoconference to improve the support system for developing the choice-making that young students with intellectual disabilities exhibit in school settings. Based on an assessment of these young students' choice-making, we examined the (1) methods to support the development of choice-making (as a behaviour chain in which a child chooses and then engages in an activity, (2) significance of such support, and (3) usefulness of videophone teleconsultation. This helped us develop and improve the students' choice-making and refine the teachers' techniques for developing choice-making in students with intellectual disabilities. This suggests that videophone teleconsultation is an effective means of supporting the development of the choice-making of students with intellectual disabilities in school situations.

The Efficacy of Therapeutic Use of Play on Improving Attention Span of Mild Intellectually Disabled Children;"Pirnazar, Tayebeh; Pourmohamadreza-Tajrishi, Masoumeh; Mohammadi, Ali Zadeh; Haidarian, Milad; Ahmadi, Ahmad";Objectives: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the therapeutic use of play on improving the attention span of children with Mild Intellectual Disability (MID) in elementary school. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test-post-test with a control group so that 30 girls with MID were selected from an exceptional school in Tehran City, Iran, via convenience sampling method and assigned to the experimental and control groups. The attention span of all subjects was assessed by the Toulouse-Pieron test and the Cognitive Diagnostic Battery (CDB) before and after the therapeutic sessions. The experimental group participated in 16 therapeutic play sessions (35 minutes for each session) for 8 weeks, but the control group did not. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyze the data. Results: The Mean±SD age were 9.80±1.32 and 9.73±1.22 for the experimental and control groups, respectively. In addition, the mean attention span in the experimental group varied from 7.60 to 18.78 after the therapeutic sessions. In addition, after the therapeutic sessions, a significant difference (P<0.001) was observed between the experimental and control groups relating to attention span. According to the Eta quotient, 94% of the variation in the attention span of the experimental group is due to participating in the intervention sessions. Discussion: Therapeutic use of play is an effective method to improve the attention span of children with MID. Therefore, the therapeutic use of play can be applied to improve the academic performance of students with MID and reduce negative outcomes due to inattention Highlights • Intellectual disability is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is accompanied by deficiencies in both mental ability and adaptive functioning in three conceptual, social, and practical domains. • Play is a therapeutic technique to treat a wide range of cognitive problems. • Play therapy can assist children with mild intellectual disabilities to improve their attention span and prevent academic failure. Plain Language Summary People with intellectual disability are slower in all areas of cognitive and social development and it is difficult to do daily life skills. Distraction and inattention are two important traits in students with intellectual disability. Attention is considered a cognitive process that helps people focus on a goal, retain the information, decode a new stimulus, and shift focus from one goal to another. The limitation of attention span is a basic factor for perceiving stimuli and affects the level of learning. The results of our study showed that when children with intellectual disability participate in play, they encourage the use of speech to communicate with peers, therefore their attention skills will promote and trigger positive emotions during play. In addition, they will be able to perform daily assignments in the correct way due to paying more attention to them and their academic failure will be reduced. © 2022,Iranian Rehabilitation Journal.

The Effectiveness of an Interactive Digital Animation-Enriched Application for Teaching Concepts to Students with Intellectual Disabilities;"Ünlü, Emre; Diken, Ibrahim Halil";The prerequisite for teaching many skills and behaviors to children with intellectual disabilities is that the child has acquired the basic concepts. Teaching concepts plays a very active role in the independence of the child with intellectual disabilities and in the acquisition of higher level skills that they will learn in the future. The studies conducted in recent years show that technology-based applications are effective in teaching concepts to children with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a technology-enhanced concept teaching application enriched with digital animations in teaching basic concepts to children with intellectual disabilities. Two male students diagnosed with intellectual disabilities participated in the study. In determining the ethics of technology-enhanced concept teaching practice, the multiple probe between skills model, which is one of the methods of single-subject research, was used. As a result of the study, it was found that the use of technology-assisted concept teaching was effective in teaching basic concepts to children with intellectual disabilities, that the children continued the concepts learned after the end of the instruction, and that they generalized them to different situations.;2022;;International Technology and Education Journal;6;1;51-58;"2860871485; EJ1359810";;;#44258;Ünlü 2022;

The Effects of Adapted Physical Education and Sports Activities on Mental Adjustment Levels and Determination of Communication Skills of Trainable Mentally Handicapped Individuals;Yildirim, Zeynep;This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise training on mental adaptation levels and communication skills in mentally handicapped individuals who were at an educable level. Based on this purpose, the Performance Determination Form for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities, which was created in 2018 within the scope of the Ministry of National Education, General Directorate of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, and Hacettepe Spiritual Adaptation Scale developed by Gökler and Öktem (1985) were given to the families of 11 mentally disabled individuals, (3 girls and 8 boys), with a mean age of 11.90. Afterward, 130 hours of adapted physical education and sports activities were applied to 11 trainable mentally retarded individuals, 90 minutes a day, 2 days a week for 12 weeks. After this activity, the same measurements were performed by the families again and the differences were examined. As a result of SPSS, although there was no statistical significance in the behavioural and neurotic results, which were the sub-dimensions of the psychological adjustment variable, a decrease was observed in the post-test mean scores after the exercise program was applied. This result proves that physical education and sports activities have positive effects on the mental adjustment of individuals with educable mental disabilities. Findings on receptive language skills and expressive language skills, which were sub-dimensions of the participants' communication skills, were examined. While the mean receptive language skills pre-test score was 31.72±3.00, the post-test mean score was 127.09±6.18, the expressive language skills pre-test mean score was 13.27±2.37, and the post-test mean score was 54.63±1.56. The observed difference was statistically significant. As can be seen, it was determined that physical education and sports activities applied have positive effects on individuals with educable mental disabilities, both in terms of psychological adaptation and communication skills. As a result, it has been determined in this research that physical education activities, which are an integral part of education, are very beneficial in terms of mental adaptation and communication skills, which are vital for individuals with mental disabilities.;2022;;Journal of Educational Issues;8;3;135-148;"2861152704; EJ1365766";;;#44232;Yildirim 2022;
An Experimental Study in Determining Basic Robotic Coding Skills of Pre-School Students with Intellectual Disabilities;"Yildiz, Ezgi Pelin; Çengel, Metin";Today, it can be said that coding has become a key competence for students and people working in many different fields in the business world. It is assumed that those who seek and develop new ways to learn-teach coding will be one step ahead. The educational use of coding started with the use of the Logo programming language in the 60s.This concept has started to revive in recent years with visual programming languages such as “Alice, its code, code.org and Scratch”. These visual programming structures enable young learners to write applications without having to learn the complex code structures of traditional programming languages. In this study to develop an experimental study to determine the basic robotic coding skills of preschool students with intellectual disabilities. The sample of the study consists of a total of 20 students with studying in pre-school education institutions in a city in Türkiye. The ages of the students are between 5 years old. Semi-experimental design, one of the experimental research designs, was used in the research. In this context, 1 experimental and 1 control group was formed with the random assignment method. The materials used in both the experimental and control groups were determined as the preschool robotic coding set U-bot starter package.5 weeks were determined as the teaching process and a total of 12 activities that served the purpose were applied to the students. During the applications, the data of the students were collected with the help of the observation form, coding skill test and after the application, they were collected through focus group interviews. As a result, at the end of the 5-week period, it was observed that there were positive significant changes in the two dependent variables (academic achievement andlearning rate) that were used as a basis for measuring the learning skills of both the experimental group and the control group students. © 2022,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies.

An ID group (age, M = 15.25 years, SD = 2.76) and a control group without ID (age, M = 15.11 years, SD = 1.54) performed visual simple and choice reaction times, auditory simple reaction time, and finger tapping tests before and after running at low or moderate intensity (30% and 60% of heart rate reserve [HRR], respectively). Visual simple reaction time values decreased (p < .001) after both intensities at all time points with higher (p = .007) extend after the 60% HRR intensity for both groups. After both intensities, the VCRT decreased (p < .001) in the ID group at all time points compared with preexercise (Pre-EX) while, in the control group, these values decreased (p < .001) only immediately (IM-EX) and after 10 min (Post-10) of exercise cessation. Compared withs Pre-EX, in the ID group, the auditory simple reaction time values decreased (p < .001) at all time points after the 30% HHR intensity whereas, after the 60% HRR, these values decreased only at IM-EX (p < .001), Post-10 (p = .001) and Post-20 (p < .001). In the control group, auditory simple reaction time values decreased (p = .002) only after the 30% HRR intensity at IM-EX.

The Effect of Sex Education Intervention on Sexual Knowledge of Female Adolescents with Intellectual Disabilities;"Alamdarloo, Ghorban Hemati; Moradi, Shahram; Padervand, Hafez; Dorahi, Asma Zare";The present study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a Sex Education Intervention on sexual knowledge in a group of female adolescents with intellectual disabilities. This research was conducted in a pretest-posttest design with a control group. The sample included 30 female adolescents with intellectual disabilities that were selected through convenience sampling and randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group and a control group (15 participants in each group). The experimental group received 18 sessions of a Sex Education Intervention while the control group did not receive this intervention. Assessment of Sexual Knowledge in Adolescents (ASKA) was used to measure sexual knowledge of the adolescents. The results showed that Sex Education Intervention improved general sexual knowledge and subscales like parts of the body, public and private parts and places, puberty, relationships, social sexual boundaries, safe sex practices, and sex and the law in the experimental group. However, no effect of the intervention was observed in subscales of masturbation and sexuality. The present research emphasizes the importance of Sex Education Intervention in increasing sexual knowledge in female adolescents with intellectual disabilities.;2023;2023-09;SEXUALITY AND DISABILITY;41;3;663-676;;10.1007/s11195-023-09777-z;;#40391;Alamdarloo 2023;wos_update
Effects of video-prompting using iPad on teaching leisure activities to students with multiple disabilities: A single-case experimental design study;Aldabas, Rashed;Video-prompting has been found to be effective for teaching skills to students with severe developmental dis-abilities. However, there has been little research on the effectiveness of video-promoting for teaching leisure activities to students with multiple disabilities. This study evaluated the efficacy of iPad-based video-prompting for the teaching of leisure activities to high school students with multiple disabilities. A multiple-baseline design across three participants was employed to evaluate intervention effectiveness. The findings indicated that all participants were able to successfully and independently perform the leisure activity after the intervention, and the students maintained their knowledge of the learned skills after two weeks. While using video-prompting in teaching the leisure activity (listening to music), there was an immediate positive change in the three students' performance levels in the independent completion and acquisition of the steps of listening to music activity. Therefore, it was concluded this video-prompting iPad-based instructional method was effective for teaching leisure activities to students with multiple disabilities.;2023;2023-01;CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW;144;;;;10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106695;;#40590;Aldabas 2023;wos_update
The effect of the simultaneous Prompting-Constant time delay instructional sequence on the teaching of early academic skills to students with intellectual disabilities;Aldosiry, Norah;This study investigated the effectiveness of combining simultaneous prompting (SP) and constant time delay (CTD) (hereafter SP-CTD instructional sequence) in teaching early academic skills to five students with intel-lectual disabilities (ID). A multiple-probe design was used to examine the functional relationship between the SP and CTD instructional sequence and the acquisition of letter-sound correspondences and number recognition. The results showed the effectiveness of the procedure, as all students acquired their target skills in 7-12 sessions, with an average error rate of 8%. Maintenance effects were assessed at 2, 6, and 10 weeks after the intervention to measure participants' retention of these acquired skills. Three students preserved their skills with 100% ac-curacy, while two students did so with more than 90% accuracy. The data indicate that instruction consisting of probe trials, 0-s trials, and 5-s trials leads to improvements in early academic skills among students with ID.;2023;2023-04;LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION;84;;;;10.1016/j.learninstruc.2022.101728;;#40440;Aldosiry 2023;wos_update
Tangible digital collaborative storytelling in adolescents with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders;"Alonso‐Campuzano, Cristina; Iandolo, Giuseppe; Filosofi, Fabio; Tardivo, Angela; Sosa‐González, Noelia; Pasqualotto, Angela; Venuti, Paola";Background Collaborative storytelling can be a helpful tool to promote cognitive and social skills in adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders. Aims The current study aimed to explore the benefits of collaborative storytelling using traditional (TST), digital (DST), and tangible digital (TDST) methodologies. Materials and Methods Fourteen Spanish students with mild to moderate intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental comorbid disorders participated in collaborative storytelling sessions in the classroom, following an experimental, mixed, and cross‐sectional design. The study comprised three individual assessments of narrative skills and eight collaborative storytelling sessions using different storytelling methodologies. Individual and collaborative stories were videotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analysed for formal and content characteristics. Behaviours and interactions during the collaborative storytelling were analysed for each group and session. Results The results show a positive effect of collaboration on students' stories, compared to individual performance, regardless of the methodology used. Conclusion Collaboration, technological device handling, and shared storytelling did not present a barrier for the participants.

Teaching expository writing to Arabic-speaking students with intellectual disability in inclusive classrooms: effect of four-square method and sentence frames;"Bakry, Mohamed S.; Emam, Mahmoud Mohamed";Expository writing (EW) is crucial for the literacy development of students with intellectual disabilities (ID) in inclusive classrooms. Students with ID, however, struggle with EW due to problems with generating, organizing, and producing text. Similarly, teachers of students with ID face challenges with employing the appropriate instructional method to teach EW to students with ID. The current study, therefore, investigated the effectiveness of combining two instructional methods, namely the Four-Square Writing Method and Sentence Frames, in teaching EW skills to students with ID. Using a single group pretest posttest quasi experimental design, 8 students with mild ID who received their education in inclusive classroom in one of the suburban schools in Egypt participated in the study. Participants were aged between 11 and 12 and were enrolled in grades 5 and 6. An intervention instructional program was implemented to teach EW to participants. Prior to and following the intervention participants' EW was evaluated with regard to paragraph length, structure and coherence. Results showed that the use of both strategies had a positive effect on students' EW. Additionally, students retained their intervention gains after a follow up duration of eight weeks. Implications are discussed in relation to the context of teaching literacy skills to students with ID in Egypt.;2023;2023-02-07;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES;;;;;10.1080/20473869.2023.2177796;;#40442;Bakry 2023;wos_update
Adapting a virtual manipulative-based instructional sequence to target maintenance;"Bassette, Laura; Bouck, Emily";The ability to maintain mathematical skills learned is critical for students to successfully engage in advanced mathematics and promote independence in daily living skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a graduated manipulative sequence consisting of virtual, representational, abstract, and an extended abstract phase (VRAEa) to teach various types of mathematical problems to three students with autism and mild intellectual disability using a multiple probe across behavior single case design. This study extended previous research on the virtual, representational, abstract sequence (VRA) to address deficiency in maintenance results through incorporating the extended abstract phase. The results indicate the intervention was effective, however, maintenance was variable.

A Virtual Number Line Intervention Package to Support Addition and Subtraction for Students with Intellectual Disability;"Bouck, Emily C.; Satsangi, Rajiv; Long, Holly; Jakubow, Larissa; O'Reilly, Carrie";Researchers established virtual manipulatives as an evidence-based practice for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). However, much of the existing research for this population targets middle school students with IDD. This study examined a virtual number line paired with teacher modeling and the system of least prompts to support high school students with IDD in acquiring, maintaining, and generalizing addition and subtraction problems. Through a single case research study with three high school students with IDD, the researchers found a functional relation between the intervention package and student accuracy. Students also became more independent but struggled to maintain their skills when prompting was not provided. Further, the students were unable to generalize the skills of addition and subtraction to real-life scenarios targeting time and money. These findings and their implications for the field of IDD are examined.;2023;;Journal of Special Education Technology;38;4;445-457;"2890000678; EJ1397534";https://doi.org/10.1177/01626434221135144;;#44064;Bouck 2023;eric_update
ID Tech: A Virtual Reality Simulator Training for Teenagers with Intellectual Disabilities;"Capallera, Marine; Pierart, Genevieve; Carrino, Francesco; Cherix, Robin; Rossier, Amelie; Mugellini, Elena; Abou Khaled, Omar";People with intellectual disability (ID) should routinely train themselves to carry out a variety of daily challenging tasks while being supervised by one or more supervisors. Virtual reality (VR) technology enables the simulation of certain learning scenarios that would be risky or difficult to set up or repeatedly replicate in the actual world. This paper introduces a VR simulator created for this aim with the assistance of social educators. The purpose is to use VR to conduct learning exercises with teenagers with ID and assess the extent to which the abilities learned in VR can be transferred to the real world. This project focuses mainly on urban mobility with three types of exercise. A study was conducted with 18 students in five institutions for 7 months. Post-tests were also carried out after 1 month with 11 teenagers. In the end, four teenagers are completely autonomous in their travels: two travel on foot and two travel by public transport. Regarding the impact analysis, the results are stable over time regarding self-reported ease, satisfaction, and fatigability. Finally, the system received valuable feedback from the educators.;2023;2023-03;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;13;6;;;10.3390/app13063679;;#40314;Capallera 2023;wos_update
IMPROVING SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS OF STUDENTS WITH MILD IN℡LECTUAL DISABILITIES;"Coruhlu, Tulay Senel; Calik, Muammer; Nas, Sibel Er; Bilgin, Busra";Relevant literature has an unexplored question on how prediction-observation-explanation (POE) worksheets affect science process skills of students with mild intellectual disabilities (SMID). Therefore, this research aimed to examine the effect of POE worksheets developed for the “matter and its nature” subject on SMID's science process skills. Through pre-experimental research design, 12 fifth grade SMID participated in the research. To collect data, the researchers used science process skills development forms and rubrics to score their observations. During the teaching intervention, SMID implemented three POE worksheets, which included buzz 22 technique in the `prediction' stage, hands- on experiments and QR codes in the `observation' stage and snowball, learning gallery or card showing techniques in the `evaluation' stage. The results indicated that the POE worksheets are effective at developing SMID's science process skills of the “matter and its nature” subject. This research recommends that future comparative research should unveil how the POE worksheets with/without active learning techniques impact the SMID's SPS.;2023;2023;JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION;22;2;323-336;;10.33225/jbse/23.22.323;;#40549;Coruhlu 2023;wos_update
Comparison of Two Interventions in Improving Comprehension of Students With Intellectual Disability;"Cure, Goksel; Yucesoy-Ozkan, Serife";The purpose of this study was to compare the relative effects of word reading and story component interventions in developing reading comprehension of narrative texts with four students with mild levels of intellectual disability. A multielement design was used in this study. The findings revealed that the story component intervention was more effective and efficient than the word reading intervention in developing students' reading comprehension of narrative texts, and also indicated that both interventions were significantly effective in enabling subjects to answer literal questions. Only the story component intervention was significantly effective related to inferential questions.

A delayed intervention start randomized controlled trial of high- and low-tech communication training approaches for school-age autistic children with co-occurring intellectual disability;"Gilroy, Shawn P.; McCleery, Joseph P.; Leader, Geraldine";The researchers designed a delayed intervention start randomized controlled trial to compare improvements in functional communication following augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) interventions. The study compared outcomes from function-based applied behavior analytic (ABA) and eclectic non-ABA forms of classroom-based communication strategies (waitlist control) as well as from high- and low-tech forms of AAC. High-tech AAC consisted of tablet-based communication, and low-tech AAC used an exchange of picture cards. The community-based sample consisted of 29 autistic children with a co-occurring intellectual disability. Participants were randomized to groups (AAC, waitlist control), and each group received approximately 3 months of communication intervention. Multilevel modeling of learner outcomes indicated that the function-based approach produced greater improvements than the eclectic alternative, but significant differences were not observed between outcomes of high- and low-tech forms of function-based AAC. These results are consistent with earlier investigations and provide supporting evidence that both high- and low-tech forms of function-based intervention are effective for use with autistic children with accompanying intellectual disability. Additional discussion is provided regarding further research into how technology is applied and incorporated into behavior analytic programming.;2023;2023-06;JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS;56;3;593-606;;10.1002/jaba.989;;#40452;Gilroy 2023;wos_update

The effect of multisensory music drama on the interactive engagement of students with severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities;"Johnels, Linn; Wandin, Helena; Dada, Shakila; Wilder, Jenny";Background Interactive engagement, specifically attention and initiation, are considered important skills for facilitating development and learning in students with severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Prior research has suggested that music therapy and multisensory storytelling are two promising interventions for supporting interactive engagement in this population. However, there are no known/published studies that have investigated the effect of combining relevant elements from musical interaction and multisensory storytelling for this group of students. This study aims to determine the effect of a novel educational approach—MultiSensory Music Drama (MSMD)—on the interactive engagement of students with severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. Methods A single‐case experimental design, specifically an ABAB design across three participants, was used to describe the effect of MSMD on interactive engagement when compared with a control activity. School staff members' perceptions of student interactive engagement and social validity were obtained. Findings Coded video observations showed significantly higher levels of interactive engagement during MSMD for all three participants when compared to the control activity. Furthermore, the ratings on the interactive engagement from school staff members improved for two of the three participants. Finally, school staff members scored the social validity and perceived educational usefulness of the MSMD as very high. Conclusions The findings provide initial evidence that MSMD may be effective in supporting the interactive engagement of some students with severe/profound intellectual and multiple disabilities.

The effect of aided language stimulation on the acquisition of receptive vocabulary in children with complex communication needs and severe intellectual disability: A comparison of two dosages;"Laher, Zakiyya; Dada, Shakila";Aided language stimulation is an augmented input strategy that facilitates the expressive and receptive language skills of persons who require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The aim of this study was to determine and compare the acquisition of receptive vocabulary items during implementation of aided language stimulation with dosages of 40% and 70%, respectively. An adapted alternating treatment design was replicated across six participants with complex communication needs and severe intellectual disability. All participants demonstrated receptive vocabulary acquisition when aided language stimulation was provided with a dosage of 70%, and two participants demonstrated acquisition when a dosage of 40% was provided. Receptive vocabulary acquisition was maintained following a 6-day withdrawal period. The dosage of augmented input may impact receptive vocabulary acquisition for children with complex communication needs and severe intellectual disability, with higher dosages being more effective for some participants. The findings indicate that clinicians should be aware that dosage is an important consideration when providing aided language stimulation to facilitate receptive vocabulary acquisition in children with complex communication needs and severe intellectual disability.

M.; Hinton, Vanessa M. M.; Dunn, Caroline; Darch, Craig B. B.";This study investigated the effects of a place value intervention with third-grade students with learning disabilities. The intervention added content to a research-based intervention using the concrete-representational-abstract (CRA) sequence. The added content reflected current mathematics standards for third grade. Students' place value understanding was measured using probes in which students had to identify the value of each digit within a three-digit number, round three-digit numbers to the nearest 10 or 100, and write three equations showing an expanded form of a three-digit number. A single-case, multiple-probe-across-students design showed a functional relation between CRA and completion of items requiring place value understanding. Students completed a generalization task by estimating the sum of a given equation.;2023;2023-02;LEARNING DISABILITIES RESEARCH & PRACTICE;38;1;15-25;;10.1111/ldrp.12299;;#40770;Milton 2023;wos_update
Video Modeling and Systematic Instructions to Teach Graphing Skills to Elementary School Students With Intellectual and Hearing Disabilities;"Nagayama, Kohei; Tsutomu, Kamiyama; Wakabayashi, Kazusa";"Systematic instruction and video modeling are evidence-based practices for teaching academic skills to students with intellectual disabilities; however, its efficacy has not been established for teaching graphing skills in a small-group setting. Three elementary school students with hearing and intellectual disabilities were taught to describe graphs and compare their differences in a math class at a special needs school using systematic instruction and video modeling. The effectiveness was evaluated using a multiple-baseline across participants' design. The results showed an increase in correct response rates after the intervention, with similar levels of correct response rates in the probe and graphing based on tables phases. A functional relation was demonstrated between systematic instruction and video modeling and graphing behaviors.";2023;2023-08-19;JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION;;;;;10.1177/00224669231192967;;#40475;Nagayama 2023;wos_update
Effects of a physical education intervention on attention and inhibitory control in Ecuadorian children with intellectual disabilities;"Piedra, Angelica Liseth Mero; Pesthy, Orsolya; Marton, Klara";"Background: Studies on physical activity interventions indicated a facilitative effect on cognitive performance in persons with intellectual disabilities; however, research is scarce, especially in low/middle-income countries. Aim: We explored the effects of a 6-week enriched physical education program on inhibitory control and attention functions in Ecuadorian children with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Thirty children with mild intellectual disabilities (10-14 years old) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Before and after the intervention, attention and inhibitory control were measured using computer-based nonverbal tasks. Results: The findings showed significantly more accurate and faster responses in the vigilance task in the intervention group than in the controls. There were no significant intervention-related changes in inhibitory control; however, there were more prominent accuracy tendencies toward improvement in the intervention group. Conclusions: Results provide evidence of the potential of physical activity programs to enhance attention in this population, which could serve as a mediator for inhibitory control.";2023;2023-07-17;JOURNAL OF IN℡LECTUAL DISABILITIES;;;;;10.1177/17446295231189018;;#40415;Piedra 2023;wos_update

The subjects were 40 students of grade 1 to 3 who had a learning disabilities or mild intellectual disabilities. The students were selected by using purposive sampling and were studying in the second semester of the 2021 academic year at eight government schools with special education programs: 1. Rajaprajanugroh 46 School 2. Wat Samuha Pradit School 3. Watnonsaparam School 4. Anuban Saohai School 5. Wat Sathu Prachasan School 6. Anuban Saradaeng School 7. Watkhaojumpa School 8. Anuban Saraburi School. The research instruments were employed: 1) the word reading test, 2) the lesson plan for word reading, 3) the awareness of morality evaluation, 4) the students' happiness questionnaire, and 5) the teachers' satisfaction questionnaire. Descriptive statistics (i.e., percentage, dependent sample t-test) were used to analyze the data. The main findings can be summarized as follows: 1) The picture storytelling books: The content was related to eight types of morality, which included diligence, saving, honesty, being disciplined, Manners, cleanliness, harmony and kindness. The CVI scores of stories 1, 4, and 7 were 0.97-1.00 and stories 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 were 1.00. 2) the word reading ability of the students who had learning disabilities was excellent and mild intellectual disabilities was below average; 3) the word reading ability of both groups was higher; 4) the students' awareness of morality and happiness was high; and 5) the teachers were strongly satisfied with using the picture storytelling books.";2023;2023-07;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION;16;3;245-260;;10.29333/iji.2023.16314a;;#40355;Saksiriphol 2023;wos_update
App-based mathematical intervention for youth with intellectual disabilities: a randomised controlled trial;"Schoeld, Daniel; Ostergren, Rickard; Leven, Anna; Hassler-Hallstedt, Martin; Traff, Ulf";The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether students with intellectual disabilities (ID) can improve their arithmetic skills by participating in an arithmetic intervention programme, theoretically founded on explicit instruction (EI) and administered via an application developed for tablet computers. The intervention study used a randomised controlled trial design (RCT) (n = 30, aged 10-16, 13 females) and lasted for up to 12 weeks. The results show that the intervention group significantly improved in arithmetic fact fluency compared to the controls and the effects remained six months after the intervention. The effects were larger for subtraction than for addition, and this difference remained six months later. These results suggest that mathematics applications based on explicit instruction can be an effective way of teaching arithmetic facts to youth with mild ID.;2023;2023-02-08;SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH;;;;;10.1080/00313831.2023.2175250;;#40306;Schoeld 2023;wos_update
Teaching Students With a Mild Intellectual Disability to Respond to Strangers Using Computer-Based Video Instruction;"Simmons, Chelsey R.; Miller, Rhonda D.; Uphold, Nicole M.; Horn, Suzanne E.";Computer-based video instruction (CBVI) has been effective in teaching students with disabilities various health, community, and safety skills. Research suggests that CBVI is often used in conjunction with community-based instruction (CBI). Frequently, students with severe disabilities or students who are of high school age participate in CBI and/or CBVI and its accompanying research. This study investigated the effectiveness of CBVI to teach students with a mild ID, ages 11-13, appropriate responses to lures from strangers. A single-case, multiple probe across participants design was used to examine the impact of CBVI on one dependent variable, a correct two-step response (verbal and motor) to a lure from a stranger. The two-step response was adapted from the Akmanoglu & Tekin-Iftar (2011) study investigating responses to strangers. Data indicated that CBVI had a positive impact on all four participants. Participants also maintained the skill (up to 5 weeks) and generalized to a novel setting. Parents and teachers involved in the study also reported positive opinions regarding the aim and outcomes of the study. Implications for practice and for future research are provided.;2023;2023-03-24;JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY;;;;;10.1177/01626434231165969;;#40419;Simmons 2023;wos_update
Increasing Pizza Box Assembly Using Task Analysis and a Least-To-Most Prompting Hierarchy;"Stabnow, Erin F. F.; Rieger, Heather K. K.; Sweeney, William J. J.";The purpose of this study was to determine whether a least-to-most prompting hierarchy was effective in teaching students with intellectual disabilities to increase the number of task-analyzed steps independently completed related to folding a pizza box as a potential pre-vocational task. An additional and related purpose of this study was to determine whether a least-to-most prompting hierarchy was effective for improving these students' productivity while decreasing the level of least-to-most prompts required to complete task-analyzed steps of a pizza box assembly task. A multiple-baseline design across subjects was used to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation of a least-to-most prompting hierarchy. Results of this study indicated that the use of a task analysis and a least-to-most prompting hierarchy was effective in teaching individuals with intellectual disabilities pizza box assembly skills. Implications and recommendations for the use of a task analysis with least-to-most prompts for teaching complex vocational tasks to individuals with intellectual disabilities as well as possibilities for future research were also discussed.;2023;2023-07-03;CHILD & FAMILY BEHAVIOR THERAPY;45;3;169-191;;10.1080/07317107.2023.2170197;;#40520;Stabnow 2023;wos_update
The Effects of Rhythm and Dance Games on Aggression in Students with Mild Mental Disabilities;Taskin, Ali Kemal;The aim of this study is to examine the effects of rhythm and dance on the aggression levels of students with mild mental disabilities. The sample group of the study consists of 40 students with mild mental disability, 20 of whom are in the experimental group and 20 in the control group, who continue their education in schools affiliated with the Kilis Provincial Directorate of National Education. Buss-Perry's (1992) aggression scale was applied as pre-test and post-test to both groups, and rhythm and dance training was given to the experimental group for 2 hours, 2 days a week for 8 weeks. In the analysis of the data obtained, frequency and percentage analysis were performed by using the SPSS 22.0 program, and dependent and independent t-test was used in the analysis of the pre-test and post-test data. No significant results were obtained in the pre-test scores of the experimental and control groups (p > 0.05). In the evaluation made between the experimental group and the control group, a significant result was reached in the post-test scores in favor of the experimental group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, based on the data obtained, we can say that rhythm and dance games positively reduce the aggression levels of children with mild mental disabilities.;2023;;Journal of Education and Learning;12;3;101-105;"2890043056; EJ1385089";;;#43969;Taskin 2023;eric_update
Effect of Model-Based Problem Solving on Error Patterns of At-Risk Students in Solving Additive Word Problems;"Xin, Yan Ping; Kim, Soo Jung; Zhang, Jingyuan; Lei, Qingli; Yenioglu, Busra Yilmaz; Yenioglu, Samed; Ma, Xiaojun";Students with learning disabilities/difficulties in mathematics often apply ineffective procedures to solve word problems due to a lack of conceptual understanding of word problem solving, which results in poor mathematics performance and falling further behind the normal achievements of their peers. Current mathematics curriculum standards emphasize conceptual understanding in problem solving as well as higher-order thinking and reasoning, including all students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a computer-assisted model-based problem-solving intervention program (MBPS) on elementary students' word problem-solving performance by analyzing the error patterns. Results indicate that after the MBPS intervention, participants significantly improved their problem-solving performance and made fewer errors in solving problems across a range of additive word problem situations. Specifically, the participating students made their attempt to represent the mathematical relation, decontextualized from the word problem story, in the model equation before solving the problem, rather than blindly applying an operation or relying on the “keyword” strategy as they did during the preassessment. Implications of the study are discussed in the context of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' calling for teaching big ideas to help students develop a deep understanding of mathematics knowledge.;2023;2023-07;EDUCATION SCIENCES;13;7;;;10.3390/educsci13070714;;#40745;Xin 2023;wos_update
Effectiveness of animation-based video modeling on daily living skills teaching to individuals with intellectual disabilities;"Yalcin, Gulistan; Kocaoz, Onur Emre; Arslantas, Tugba Kamali";The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of an animation-based teaching package on the acquisition of three daily living skills based on the performance of three middle school students with mild or moderate intellectual disability. An animation-based teaching package was designed to include explicit instructional procedures and was developed and tested by the researchers within the scope of the study in order to meet the specific needs of the target group. A multiple probe across behaviors design was applied for this single-subject research in order to investigate the effect of an animation-based daily life skills teaching package on the learning of culinary skills by three middle school students with ID. The culinary skills were sandwich preparation, brewing tea, and pouring tea. The participants in the study showed overall improvement in their task performance following the intervention. The results revealed animation-based video modeling to be an effective method in improving the acquisition of daily living skills. Animation-based teaching may be used as a means to teach effective daily living skills to students with ID.;2023;2023-05-09;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;;;;;10.1007/s10639-023-11863-w;;#40370;Yalcin 2023;wos_update
